Question: Students visited the Morris W. Offit telescope located at the Maryland Space Grant Observatory in Baltimore. They learned about the stars, planets, and moon. The students recorded the information below. • Star patterns stay the same, but their locations in the sky seem to change. • The sun, planets, and moon appear to move in the sky. • Proxima Centauri is the nearest star to our solar system. • Polaris is a star that is part of a pattern of stars called the Little Dipper. Which statement best explains why the sun appears to move across the sky each day?
Choices: {'text': ['The sun revolves around Earth.', 'Earth rotates around the sun.', 'The sun revolves on its axis.', 'Earth rotates on its axis.'], 'label': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']}

A) Put the objects in groups.
B) Change the height of the ramp.
C) Choose different objects to roll.
D) Record the details of the investigation.


System: To ensure that Juan and LaKeisha can repeat their investigation accurately, they should record the details of their investigation. This would include information such as the type of objects used, the conditions of the ramp, and the distances rolled. Such documentation allows them to replicate the conditions and variables accurately in future trials.

Question: High-pressure systems stop air from rising into the colder regions of the atmosphere where water can condense. What will most likely result if a high-pressure system remains in an area for a long period of time?

A) fog
B) rain
C) drought
D) tornado


System: To analyze the consequences of a high-pressure system remaining over an area for an extended period, let's consider the characteristics of such systems. High-pressure systems lead to sinking air, which inhibits cloud formation and precipitation. 

Given this context, one might reason that if a high-pressure system persists, the condition it creates would likely prevent moisture accumulation, thereby resulting in dry weather. This aligns well with option C) drought, as prolonged high pressure typically leads to arid conditions rather than rain or fog.

While fog, rain, and tornadoes are potential weather phenomena, they are generally associated with low pressure and not high pressure. Thus, it seems most logical to conclude that the correct outcome, given the conditions of high pressure, would be a lack of moisture leading to drought.

Answer: C
