10.1016%j.cgh.2017.01.038,"patient_presentation: A 63-year-old man with Barrett’s esophagus (C5M6) with multifocal high-grade dysplasia and residual esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) despite multiple endoscopic mucosal resections sought a non-surgical treatment.
imaging_without_photo: We utilized advanced imaging along with volumetric laser endomicroscopy (VLE) to delineate the extent of dysplasia and cancer to determine resection margin. Consequently, circumferential endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) of the distal 9 cm was successfully performed to the gastric cardia.
imaging_test_with_photo: Histologic subtypes were mapped on the gross specimen photograph (A). ESD resection margins were negative and 3-month surveillance biopsies demonstrate no residual disease.
next_imaging: The utility of computer-enhanced VLE was explored. VLE was performed prior to ESD, processed with an offline prototype algorithm (NinePoint Medical, Bedford, MA) and reconstructed into en-face (B) and endoscopic fly-through (C) views that closely resembled the ex-vivo specimen and EGD image (D).
","The algorithim highlighted features previously associated with suspected dysplasia, including hyper-reflective tissue surface signal (orange), hypo-reflective cystic structures above the submucosal layer (pink), and loss of layered architecture (blue). These features clustered together over areas of dysplasia and cancer.",COMMON,184
10.1016%j.cgh.2018.09.004,"patient_presentation: A 76-year-old woman with no previous medical history presented with swelling, redness, and induration at the umbilicus. 
additional_history: The patient first was diagnosed with eczema at a local hospital. She was treated wtih topical cortiocosteroids without improvement. After 8 months, she consulted for peri-umbilical painful nodules.
imaging_test_with_photo: Clinical examination showed 2 firm and inflamed peri-umbilical nodules measuring 1 and 2 cm (Figure A, black arrow).....The serum marker of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 was increased (202.1 U/mL).
next_imaging: Abdominal computed tomography showed a pancreatic tail mass of 73 x 32 mm (Figure B, red arrow) with hepatic metastases (Figure B, yellow arrows). The pathologic study of the peri-umbilical nodules conclued to an infiltration with a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma.
",The diagnosis of Sister Mary Joseph's nodules (SMJNs) was suspected....The diagnosis of metastatic pancreatic carcinoma discovered by SMJN was retained.,COMMON,24
10.1016%j.cgh.2018.05.033,"patient_presentation: A 61-year-old man with abdominal distention, pain, and nausea was admitted to our hospital. 
additional_history: He had a 34-year history of Crohn's disease and previously underwent a right hemicolectomy and repeated ileal resections. At 47 years, he developed short-bowel syndrome (small bowel length, 160 cm), and since then he had been treated wtih total parenteral nutrition without taking any nutrition by mouth.
imaging_test_with_photo: Computed tomography showed 2 intraluminal ovoid calcified masses in the remnant ileum (Figure A).
next_imaging: Emergent laparotomy was performed, and 75 cm of ileum containing the stricture site and 2 huge calculi was resected. The stone sizes were 11 and 13 cm (Figure B). Infrared spectorscopy analysis showed that the components of these calculi were simliar to bile acid.
",We diagnosed small-bowel obstruction because of enterolithiasis and underlying stenosis.,UNCOMMON,68
10.1016%j.cgh.2017.08.003,"patient_presentation: An 81-year-old woman was referred to our facility for the management of new onset dysphagia to solids.
additional_history: She had a history of oropharyngeal leukoplakia, which was being followed by ear, nose, and throat doctor. She had several medical comorbidities including ischemic heart disease with automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. She denied any tobacco or alcohol use. 
imaging_test_with_photo: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed narrowing of the proximal esophagus with characteristic white plaques suggestive of esophageal leukoplakia (Figure A). 
next_imaging: Endoscopic mucosal resection was performed, resulting in the successful removal of the lesion (Figure C).
third_imaging: A repeat endoscopy after 8 weeks showed near complete resolution of leukoplakia with no evidence of stricture (Figure D).

10.1016%j.cgh.2017.07.036,"patient_presentation: A 29-year-old woman with Crohn’s fistulizing ileocolitis presented for colonoscopy.
additional_history: During the previous 10 years, she had persistent loose stools and abdominal pain with mesalamine/prednisone, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, natalizumab, and then methotrexate. Each treatment was trialed sequentially for approximately 1 year before determining non-response. After 3 years of standard-dose ustekinumab therapy, the patient had fewer loose stools and less pain/bloating, but routine magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed active Crohn’s disease from the splenic flexure to the anus with possible stricture.
imaging_test_with_photo: Endoscopic evaluation showed nodular mucosa from 0 to 50 cm proximal to the anus, and this area was biopsied (Figure A).

10.1016%j.cgh.2018.05.052,"patient_presentation: A 63-year-old woman with cirrhosis was transferred to our medical facility for higher-level care after outside hospitalization for dizziness, nausea, and right upper-quadrant pain.
additional_history: On arrival, she additionally reported nonbloody emesis, epigastric pain, and early satiety with postprandial discomfort. 
imaging_test_with_photo: The patient underwent oral endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) for a yellowish 4-cm submucosal tumor at the gastric body with a positive pillow sign (Figure A).
next_imaging: On EUS, a vascular structure appeared at the bulge that was highly suggestive of a splenic artery aneurysm (SAA) based on Doppler readout (Figures B and C). Because the vessel appeared to originate from the splenic hilum and did not breach the submucosal space, varices were ruled out in favor of gastric extraluminal compression by SAA.
third_imaging: Concordantly, magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple short fusiform SAAs at the hilum up to 1.8 cm in diameter (Figure D). The splenic artery was patent despite thrombus occlusion proximally, and moderate splenomegaly was recorded at 16.5 cm.
","A surgical consult concluded that the small SSA was unlikely to be the cause of abdominal pain, and intervention was deemed unnecessary.",COMMON,66
10.1016%j.cgh.2018.01.043,"patient_presentation: An 84-year-old woman presented with 2-days of epigastric pain accompanied by nausea and coffee-ground emesis.
physical_exam: Physical examination revealed mild tenderness in the epigastrium and a succussion splash.
imaging_test_with_photo: Computed tomography of the abdomen demonstrated findings consistent with a gastric outlet obstruction and a large irregular fluid and gas-filled collection centered on the first and second portions of the duodenum (Figure A, arrow).
next_imaging: On esophagogastroduodenoscopy, a fistula was found in the gastric antrum (Figure B) with evidence of a large gallstone within the fistula tract (Figure C).
third_imaging: Electrohydraulic lithotripsy was performed along with stenting of the fistula under fluoroscopic guidance to prevent further stone impaction (Figure D) and a nasojejunal (NJ) feeding tube was placed for nutritional support.

10.1016%j.cgh.2018.03.035,"patient_presentation: An 83-year-old man presented two years earlier with iron deficiency anemia.
additional_history: The patient tolerated chemotherapy for two years but re-presented to our care with symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction. An upper endoscopy revealed a malignant appearing antral ulcer that did not involve the pylorus. Cross-sectional imaging showed metastatic disease to peri-gastric lymph nodes and the peritoneum.
imaging_test_with_photo: Computed tomography/position emissions tomography showed just focal disease at the pylorus (yellow arrow) with a distended stomach and an air-fluid level (red arrow, A).
next_imaging: On endoscopy, malignant pyloric stenosis was observed that was focal in nature (B).
third_imaging: The decision was made to place a 15 mm lumen-apposing metal stent given the focal disease, the need for a short stent that would not migrate, and the barbell shape that would help prevent migration with continued chemotherapy (C). The stent was placed successfully under endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance over a wire.

10.1016%j.cgh.2018.03.019,"patient_presentation: Here we describe an 88-year-old woman with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension presenting wtih severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
physical_exam: Physical exam revealed an afebrile woman with right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness without peritoneal signs. Her abdomen was distended and tympanic with diminished bowel sounds.
imaging_test_with_photo: Initial x-ray suggested free air beneath the right hemidiaphgram, as noted in image A, concerning for pneumoperitoneum.
next_imaging: Computed tomography (CT) scan was obtained which showed a severely distended right colon caught between the liver and right hemidiaphragm, as in image B and C.
","This is termed Chilaiditi sign,  a right colonic volvulus that was impinged between the liver and right hemidiaphragm without evidence of an intestinal perforation",UNCOMMON,93
10.1053%j.gastro.2020.01.038,"patient_presentation: A 70-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with 3 weeks of melena and one recent episode of coffee ground vomiting on a background of intermittent abdominal pain, anorexia and weight loss of 5 kilograms over the preceding three months. 
additional_history: Her other medical history was significant for atrial fibrillation treated with apixaban as well as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. She was hemodynamically stable and had mild epigastric tenderness with no features of peritonism.
physical_exam: Digital rectal examination confirmed melena.
initial_laboratory_results: Initial laboratory values showed normocytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 6.0g/dL, urea of 37.2mg/dL, creatinine of 1.09mg/dL and liver function tests within the normal range.
imaging_test_with_photo: A gastroscopy was performed, which demonstrated a large, solid, incompressible spherical object in the first part of the duodenum with associated semicircumferential mucosal ulceration but no active bleeding (Figure A and Figure B).
next_imaging: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen was performed after the gastroscopy, with axial (Figure C) and coronal (Figure D) images shown.
",There was significant resistance to pushing the object distally and it was too large to extract through the pylorus.,UNCOMMON,196
10.1016%j.cgh.2018.02.003,"patient_presentation: An 81-year-old man presented with a brutal upper abdominal pain, malaise, sweating and vomiting.
imaging_test_with_photo: Upper GI endoscopcy confirmed the presence of gallstone in the duodenum (A) and identified the cholecystoduodenal fistula next to the cystic duct (B). Unfortunately, several mechanical removal techniques including Dormia (Endo-flex) and Baskets (Boston), duodenal balloon dilatation, cap aspiration, twister net and captivator failed, partially due to the rounded shape of the biliary stone. 
next_imaging: Endoscopic lithotripsy (Siemens Lithoskop) was then performed by drilling a hole through the biliary stone which allowed insertion of a guide-wire inside the tunnel thus created (C). Trying to widen the tunnel with a Soehendra biliary dilatation balloon, allowed only partial fragmentation of the stone.
third_imaging: A complete biliary stone fragmentation was eventually achieved with laser lithotripsy (D).
",Computed tomography revealed an important distension of both the stomach and the first portion of the duodenum consistent with intestinal obstruction as well as a 3cm biliary stone in the second portion of the duodenum.,UNCOMMON,108
10.1016%j.cgh.2018.08.013,"patient_presentation: A 73-year-old man was admitted for health care-associated bilateral pneumonia and was treated with piperacillin/tazobactam.
additional_history: No mibrobiological agent was identified. Past medical history was relevant for 2 recent and long hospital admissions for severe depression with psychotic symptoms. The patient continued to refuse food and weight loss persisted despite resolution of pneumonia.
imaging_test_with_photo: An upper digestive endoscopy was performed and the examination showed numerous scattered and coalescing white plaques in the distal two thirds of the esophagus (Figure A).
","The lesions were suggestive of esophageal candidiasis and therefore fluconazola was prescribed. However, the biopsy specimens showed ulcerated esophagitis and the presence of herpes viral inclusions.",COMMON,42
