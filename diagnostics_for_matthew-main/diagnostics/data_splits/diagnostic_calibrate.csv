10.1053%j.gastro.2016.08.048,"patient_presentation: A 14-year-old girl of African descent, presented with severe abdominal pain at the pediatric department. 
additional_history: The pain had started 3 days earlier and initially was intermittent, diffuse, and cramping. At presentation it had become continuous, progressively increasing in intensity, and accompanied by vomiting up to 3 times a day. She reported the tendency to move around constantly in search of a comfortable position. There was no fever, diarrhea, or dysuria and she regularly passed stool. Her medical history was unremarkable and she claimed not to be sexually active. 
physical_exam: On clinical examination, a sick-looking girl was noted with normal vital signs. Auscultation of heart and lungs revealed no abnormalities. A non-distended abdomen with reduced abdominal peristalsis was noted in addition to diffuse tenderness at the slightest touch, hampering deep palpation. No muscle guarding was noted, however. The intra-abdominal organs could not be palpated and there was no vaginal discharge.
initial_laboratory_results: Her laboratory results showed hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 67.3 fL, leukocytes of 10.2 x 10^3/μL, platelets of 394 x 10^3 μ/mL, serum iron of 20 μg/dL, C-reactive protein of 32.2 mg/dL, serum creatinine of 0.76 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen of 20 mg/dL. In addition, normal coagulation times, glucose, electrolytes, and liver enzymes were noted. Her urinalysis showed microscopic leukocyturia and hematuria with mild proteinuria (0.39 g/L), raising suspicion of a urinary tract infection. Pregnancy testing was negative.
imaging_without_photo: An ultrasound of the abdomen was done and showed some free abdominal fluid, but the appendix could not be identified. Other abdominal organs including the kidneys and gallbladder did not show stones or other abnormalities. To exclude a surgical origin a computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen with oral contrast was performed.
imaging_test_with_photo: Computed tomography imaging (Figure A) revealed the presence of free abdominal fluid, but once again no appendix could be identified. There were also signs of small bowel obstruction with a positive small bowel feces sign.

","On April 19, 2011, because the results of transrectal ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced ultrasonography showed a low-echo area with high possibility to be an abscess, the patient underwent ultrasound-guided puncturing and a drainage tubule was implanted into the cyst, from which approximately 250 mL of tawny liquid were drained.",COMMON,240
10.1016%j.cgh.2017.09.039,"patient_presentation: A 38-year-old man was referred for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
additional_history: A gastroduodenoscopy performed elsewhere for chronic dyspepsia showed a foreign body in the duodenum that was considered to be an endoprothesis in either the pancreas or biliary tract. His medical history showed previous hospital admissions as a result of dyspepsia in 2012 and 2015, and the patient had been homeless for several months in 2012. Laboratory tests in 2012 showed an increased amylase level of 575 U/L (normal range, 0-100 U/L), but at these previous admissions the patient repeatedly had left the hospital before further imaging had taken place.
