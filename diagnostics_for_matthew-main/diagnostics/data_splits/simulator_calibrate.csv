10.1053%j.gastro.2016.11.054,"patient_presentation: A 45-year-old man presented with intermittent abdominal pain, dark urine, and constipation for 6 months.
additional_history: The patient was discharged with abnormal liver biochemistry. For the past 4 weeks, the abdominal pain became diffuse, and the episodes lasted from a few minutes to several hours....He had consumed 100-g hot yellow rice wine (10 g alcohol) from the tin pot per day for 20 years. One year prior, he acquired a new tin pot to replace the old one.
physical_exam: Upon examination, the skin and sclera were mildly icteric; there was diffuse abdominal pain on palpation. 
initial_laboratory_results: Laboratory tests of the initial episode showed total bilirubin 109.9 μmol/L (reference range, 3.4-20.5), alanine aminotransferase 3500 U/L (reference range, 9-40), aspartate aminotransferase 1860 U/L (reference range, 15-40), gamma-glutamyl transferase 763 U/L (reference range, 10-60), and alkaline phosphatase 164 U/L (reference range, 45-125)....Laboratory tests on admission showed mild abnormal liver biochemistry, a normocytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 118 g/L (reference range, 130-175), creatinine 138 μmol/L (reference range, 59-104), and blood urea nitrogen 10.5 mmol/L (reference range, 2.85-7.14). 
imaging_test_with_photo: A purple-blue line (Figure A) at the edge of the gums was noticed. 
next_imaging: Abdominal anteroposterior radiograph showed multiple air–fluid levels and dilated bowel (Figure B).
third_imaging: On day 3 of the admission, a repeated abdominal anteroposterior radiograph showed the air–fluid levels significantly decreased (Figure C) after administration with fasting water and gastrointestinal decompression.
","On day 4, the patient’s 26-year-old daughter complained of dark urine, and liver biochemistry showed acute liver injury. She had consumed 50 g hot yellow rice wine (5 g alcohol) from the tin pot per day for 10 years.",UNCOMMON,213
10.1016%j.cgh.2018.09.018,"patient_presentation: A 31-year-old man with history of living donor renal transplantation was admitted for 2 weeks of nonradiating epigastric abdominal pain and bilious emesis.
physical_exam: Exam showed an obese, soft abdomen with normal bowel sounds and mild epigastric tenderness. 
initial_laboratory_results:  Labs showed chronic normocytic anemia
imaging_without_photo: Abdominal x-ray was unrevealing.
imaging_test_with_photo: Push enteroscopy found 2 large duodenal and jejunal ulcers (Figure A and B).
","Six weeks before presentation, he was diagnosed with renal graft failure due to cryocrystalglobulinemia.",UNCOMMON,22
10.1016%j.cgh.2017.11.029,"patient_presentation: A 53-year-old man presented with postprandial epigastric pain and weight loss for 2 months. 
additional_history: He had no significant medical or family history.
physical_exam: Physical examination was normal
initial_laboratory_results: The laboratory results were unremarkable.
imaging_test_with_photo: We performed an upper endoscopy, which showed a normal stomach and duodenum. However, the major papilla (Figure A) had an unusual appearance. We examined the patient using a duodenoscope and observed a fish-mouth-like papilla extruding thick mucus (Supplementary Video 1).
next_imaging: A multiloculated cystic lesion (5 cm) communicating with the main pancreatic duct (Figure B) and causing severe duct dilatation (14 mm) was observed in the head of the pancreas. 
","The fish-mouth appearance of papilla, although not always present (prevalence, 50%), is pathognomonic and specific (91%) for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas. We performed a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, which confirmed our suspicion of IPMN....The overall findings were suggestive of a mixed-type IPMN with high-risk features.",COMMON,132
10.1016%j.cgh.2018.01.014,"patient_presentation: A 28-year-old woman presented with epigastralgia.
additional_history: She had no history of medical conditions, allergies, or drug use.
imaging_test_with_photo: Computed tomography revealed free air and a perforation in the thickened stomach wall (Figure A). Emergency surgery revealed a 4-mm perforation in the greater curvature of the middle gastric body. Greater omentum filling was performed surgically.
next_imaging: Afterwards, a proton pump inhibitor was administered. However, because epigastric discomfort persisted and the serum eosinophils increased to 1950/μL (25.0%), esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed 2 months later, revealing a discolored, edematous, depressed lesion with an ulcer at the perforated region (Figure B).
third_imaging: The patient's symptoms improved immediately, and the lesion was healed 2 weeks later (Figure D).

10.1053%j.gastro.2014.07.036,"patient_presentation: A 51-year-old seasonal farm worker with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; CD4 count, 122 cells/mm 3) presented with persistent unexplained diarrhea, fevers, and hiccups.
initial_laboratory_results: Sputum analysis and subsequently bronchoscopy with extensive brushing revealed no evidence of acid-fast bacilli. He was anemic with a hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL and his albumin level was decreased at 2.8 g/dL. Blood, stool, and urine cultures to evaluate his recurrent fevers were also noncontributory; thus, more extensive imaging was obtained. 
imaging_test_with_photo: Although he had no pulmonary symptoms, the admission chest radiograph revealed bilateral miliary nodular opacities that were concerning for granulomatous processes including tuberculosis and fungal disease (Figure A).
next_imaging: Abdominal CT demonstrated bowel thickening of the right hemicolon and proximal transverse colon as well as adjacent inflammatory changes (Figure B).
third_imaging: Subsequent colonoscopy revealed multiple, small ulcers (Figure C).

10.1016%j.cgh.2017.11.012,"patient_presentation: A 29-year-old woman presented with 7 years of abdominal pain, distension, bloating, incomplete rectal evacuation, and food intolerance. 
additional_history: Prior gastrointestinal endoscopies, abdominal ultrasound, and computerized tomography (CT) scans were nondiagnostic. 
physical_exam: Abdominal examination showed distension, tympanic percussion note, and general tenderness, but no guarding or rebound. Rectal examination showed high and sphincter tone, levator muscle tenderness, no perineal descent, and anal contraction while straining to evacuate the examining finger. The mean resting and sphincter pressure was 135 mm Hg (normal, 26-91 mm Hg).
imaging_test_with_photo: Colonic transit by scintigraphy (Figure A) showed 44.8% isotope retained in the rectosigmoid region at 24 hours.
next_imaging: The prior abdominal CT coronal image showed copious gas in the descending colon (Figure B) and rectal gas retention (Figure C), suggesting a rectal evacuation disorder with gas distension of the descending colon.
third_imaging: The sagittal CT image (Figure D) showed gas configuration in the rectum reminiscent of a rat tail, similar to the appearance of the distal esophagus in achalasia of the cardia.
","This gas shape suggests anal achalasia, which was recognized by Sir Arthur Hurst (1925): ""achalasia affects the sphincter ani, which fails to relax when the peristaltic wave which should evacuate the rectum reaches it...strictly comparable to...achalasia of the cardia.""",UNCOMMON,137
10.1016%j.cgh.2018.08.072,"patient_presentation: A 4-year-old boy presented for esophagogastroduodenoscopy because of vomiting for 6 months.
additional_history: His medical history showed a twin pregnancy with early gestation at week 28 (weight, 850 g), with several neonatal complications. Because of delayed meconiium passage, the preterm baby had water-soluable contrast media applied through a nasogastric tube. The contrast appeared in the depeer small bowel; a double bubble was not evident. Growth, weight gain and development were unremarkable thereafter. The recent esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed food retention in the stomach and duodenal bulb, the latter appearing dilated.
imaging_test_with_photo: A small slit-like opening was identified at the superior angle, allowing passage into the descending duodenum (Figure A).
next_imaging: During the examination, invagination of the lower duodenum into the bulb occurred repeatedly (Figure B).
",Abdominal ultrasound reproduced endoscopic findings and a diagnosis of a high-grade late duodenal web was entertained.,UNCOMMON,30
