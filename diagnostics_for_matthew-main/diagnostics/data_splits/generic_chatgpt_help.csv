initial_laboratory_results: The admission laboratory testing showed a hemoglobin level of 10.6 g/dL, a normal platelet count, and a normal coagulation profile....Additional laboratory testing results were negative for Bence-Jones protein in the urine and M-component, κ-light chains, and λ light chains in the serum using immunofixation electrophoresis. 
imaging_without_photo: Electrocardiography and echocardiography were normal, and computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed no abnormal findings.

10.1053%j.gastro.2010.01.066,"patient_presentation: A 31-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of acute onset of hematochezia.
additional_history: He reported to have colicky abdominal pain 4 hours before the onset of hematochezia. He had similar attack for 4 times in the previous 10 years. Repeated upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, computed tomography (CT), and angiography all failed to identify the bleeder. Like this attack, he recalled the previous bleeding episodes were precipitated with lower abdominal colicky abdominal pain and were self-limited after conservative treatment. Two episodes of hematochezia with hypovolemic shock occurred within 2 hours after admission. He was then transferred to the intensive care unit with fluid resuscitation.
imaging_without_photo: Emergent CT angiography disclosed only blood clots in the colon.

additional_history: Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed intrahepatic bile duct dilatation, secondary to cholangiocarcinoma, type IV of Bismuth-Corlette's classification. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed wtih biliary sphincterotomy, balloon dilatation and implantation of bilateral biliary plastic stents (8.5-Fr, 12-cm). Twenty-four hours later, the patient presented fever and abdominal pain.

initial_laboratory_results: Laboratory tests were significant for a new transaminitis with aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase peak of 632/753, alkaline phosphatase of 174, and albumin of 2.2. A complete blood count showed hemoglobin/hematocrit of 11.5/34.5 and a white blood cell count of 10.0 (79% neutrophil, 11% lymphocyte, 9% monocytes). Other notable laboratory results include C-reactive protein of 38.7 (normal, 0.2-3.0) and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 124 (normal, <30). Hepatitis serologies were negative.

imaging_test_with_photo: A second procedure was scheduled in which gentle cold snare polypectomy was attempted (Figure A). However, the lesion could not be resected, probably the result of entrapment of the tip of the ICD by the snare. Diathermy was not used because of the high risk of perforation in this setting.
next_imaging: Hence, resection using the ligate-and-let-go technique was planned because it enables a slow mechanical transction of the diverticulum with a much lower risk of perforation. A standard detachable snare (MAJ-254; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) was positioned and tightened around the base of the ICD, resulting in its immediate congestion (Figure B). Submucosal tattooing was performed distally to the second ICD.
