additional_history: She was hospitalized three times in the past year with C. diff colitis. To treat her C. diff colitis, she had completed two courses of oral metronidazole and one course of oral vancomycin. In addition, she completed EGD with fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) with duodenal instillation. After referral to our gastroenterology clinic, she was started on a vancomycin pulse-taper dose and rifaximin with diarrhea improvement. Three months later, she underwent colonoscopy with FMT for diarrhea recurrence. Soon after colonoscopy with FMT, she was hospitalized again with characteristic abdominal pain and severe diarrhea.
initial_laboratory_results: Basic bloodwork was unremarkable. C. diff studies were negative.

additional_history: She underwent an emergent endoscopy that showed a duodenal stricture, which was dilated and stented. Shortly thereafter, the patient complained of severe abdominal pain and had voluntary guarding wtih peritoneal signs on physical examination.
imaging_test_with_photo: A supine radiograph was obtained and showed air on both sides of the intestinal wall, consistent with pneumoperitoneum (Figure A). This radiographic finding is known as the Rigler or double wall sign, which is particularly useful on supine imaging. However, this must be distinguished from the false double wall sign, which refers to 2 dilated loops of bowel in close apposition to one another, which may be mistaken for free air.
next_imaging: The patient underwent computed tomography that confirmed the pneumoperitoneum (Figure B), which was caused by a perforation of the duodenum by the stent. Subphrenic air also was seen (Figure B, arrowheads).

additional_history: Earlier that day, he had experienced cough, rhinorrhea, and pharyngitis. On the evening of admission, he vomited blood, prompting him to seek medical attention. He denied fevers, chills, chest pain, abdominal pain, melena, hematochezia, prior history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ingestion, or alcohol abuse. He was afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
physical_exam: Physical examination was significant for splenomegaly and brown, guaiac-positive stool. His abdomen was nontender and nondistended without overt evidence of hepatomegaly.

additional_history: Sixteen months previously the patient had a mycotic saccular aneurysm of the distal descending thoracic aorta repaired using an endovascular stent graft (Valiant Captivia Thoracic Stent Graft; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN). Long-term flucloxacillin was commenced because blood cultures taken during stent grafting grew Staphylococcus aureus. He was considered unfit for surgery.
physical_exam: His clinical examination was normal.
initial_laboratory_results: Hemoglobin, 87 g/L; mean corpuscular volume, 68.8
imaging_test_with_photo: He was referred for ugent gastroscopy and computed tomography (CT) colonography. Gastroscopy showed a potentially fungating mass protruding into the posterior wall of the esophagus (Figure A). Wires were visible on the surface of the mass, suggesting that the patient's endovascular stent had eroded into the esophagus. Remaining gastroscopy showed only occasional erosions and CT colonography was normal.
next_imaging: Eight months after the repair, the patient had an episode of chest pain with pyrexia, hypotension, and possible hematemesis. CT intially reported no abnormality of the stent graft repair and the patient was treated for angina. In light of the endoscopy findings, the CT scan was re-reviewed at the multidisciplinary meeting, and in retrospect a small defect in the esophageal wall adjacent to the stent graft was identified (Figure B, the row of arrowheads denotes the location of the stent graft, the white arrow points to air within the distal esophagus).
third_imaging: A further CT scan performed 3 weeks after endoscopy showed gas surrounding the stent graft. Absent previously, the gas confirmed the presence of an aorto-esophageal fistula (AEF) (Figure C, the radio-opaque struts of the stent graft are marked at SG, the white arrow points to air within the esophagus and to the defect in the esophageal wall, the arrowhead points to air between the aortic wall and wall of the stent graft).

imaging_without_photo: We utilized advanced imaging along with volumetric laser endomicroscopy (VLE) to delineate the extent of dysplasia and cancer to determine resection margin. Consequently, circumferential endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) of the distal 9 cm was successfully performed to the gastric cardia.
imaging_test_with_photo: The utility of computer-enhanced VLE was explored. VLE was performed prior to ESD, processed with an offline prototype algorithm (NinePoint Medical, Bedford, MA) and reconstructed into en-face (B) and endoscopic fly-through (C) views that closely resembled the ex-vivo specimen and EGD image (D). The algorithm also highlighted features previously associated with suspected dysplasia, including hyper-reflective tissue surface signal (orange), hypo-reflective cystic structures above the submucosal layer (pink), and loss of layered architecture (blue). These features clustered together over areas of dysplasia and cancer. Computer-enhanced VLE could potentially aid in delineating high-grade dysplasia and cancer in vivo as an adjunctive imaging modality.
