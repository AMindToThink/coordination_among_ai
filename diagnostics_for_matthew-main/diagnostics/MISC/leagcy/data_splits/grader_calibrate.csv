10.1016%j.cgh.2017.01.038,"patient_presentation: A 63-year-old man with Barrett‚Äôs esophagus (C5M6) with multifocal high-grade dysplasia and residual esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) despite multiple endoscopic mucosal resections sought a non-surgical treatment.
imaging_without_photo: We utilized advanced imaging along with volumetric laser endomicroscopy (VLE) to delineate the extent of dysplasia and cancer to determine resection margin. Consequently, circumferential endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) of the distal 9 cm was successfully performed to the gastric cardia.
imaging_test_with_photo: Histologic subtypes were mapped on the gross specimen photograph (A). ESD resection margins were negative and 3-month surveillance biopsies demonstrate no residual disease.
next_imaging: The utility of computer-enhanced VLE was explored. VLE was performed prior to ESD, processed with an offline prototype algorithm (NinePoint Medical, Bedford, MA) and reconstructed into en-face (B) and endoscopic fly-through (C) views that closely resembled the ex-vivo specimen and EGD image (D).","The algorithim highlighted features previously associated with suspected dysplasia, including hyper-reflective tissue surface signal (orange), hypo-reflective cystic structures above the submucosal layer (pink), and loss of layered architecture (blue). These features clustered together over areas of dysplasia and cancer.","Final Diagnosis: The patient has Barrett‚Äôs esophagus with multifocal high-grade dysplasia and residual esophageal adenocarcinoma, which has been successfully treated with circumferential endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), as evidenced by negative resection margins and no residual disease on 3-month surveillance biopsies.",CORRECT,COMMON,184
10.1016%j.cgh.2018.09.004,"patient_presentation: A 76-year-old woman with no previous medical history presented with swelling, redness, and induration at the umbilicus. 
additional_history: The patient first was diagnosed with eczema at a local hospital. She was treated wtih topical cortiocosteroids without improvement. After 8 months, she consulted for peri-umbilical painful nodules.
imaging_test_with_photo: Clinical examination showed 2 firm and inflamed peri-umbilical nodules measuring 1 and 2 cm (Figure A, black arrow).....The serum marker of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 was increased (202.1 U/mL).
next_imaging: Abdominal computed tomography showed a pancreatic tail mass of 73 x 32 mm (Figure B, red arrow) with hepatic metastases (Figure B, yellow arrows). The pathologic study of the peri-umbilical nodules conclued to an infiltration with a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma.",The diagnosis of Sister Mary Joseph's nodules (SMJNs) was suspected....The diagnosis of metastatic pancreatic carcinoma discovered by SMJN was retained.,"Based on the provided information, the patient is a 76-year-old woman who presented with swelling, redness, and induration at the umbilicus. Initially misdiagnosed with eczema, she later developed peri-umbilical painful nodules. The serum marker CA 19-9 is elevated, and imaging studies reveal a pancreatic tail mass with hepatic metastases. The pathological examination of the peri-umbilical nodules indicates infiltration with a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma.

The presence of the umbilical nodules, known as Sister Mary Joseph's nodules, in conjunction with the pancreatic mass and elevated CA 19-9, strongly suggests metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Sister Mary Joseph's nodules are often associated with intra-abdominal malignancies, particularly those originating from the gastrointestinal tract, such as the pancreas.

Final Diagnosis: Metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma with Sister Mary Joseph's nodule.",CORRECT,COMMON,24
10.1016%j.cgh.2018.05.033,"patient_presentation: A 61-year-old man with abdominal distention, pain, and nausea was admitted to our hospital. 
additional_history: He had a 34-year history of Crohn's disease and previously underwent a right hemicolectomy and repeated ileal resections. At 47 years, he developed short-bowel syndrome (small bowel length, 160 cm), and since then he had been treated wtih total parenteral nutrition without taking any nutrition by mouth.
imaging_test_with_photo: Computed tomography showed 2 intraluminal ovoid calcified masses in the remnant ileum (Figure A).
next_imaging: Emergent laparotomy was performed, and 75 cm of ileum containing the stricture site and 2 huge calculi was resected. The stone sizes were 11 and 13 cm (Figure B). Infrared spectorscopy analysis showed that the components of these calculi were simliar to bile acid.",We diagnosed small-bowel obstruction because of enterolithiasis and underlying stenosis.,"Based on the information provided, the patient has a history of Crohn's disease with multiple surgical resections leading to short-bowel syndrome. He has been on total parenteral nutrition due to his condition. The CT scan and subsequent laparotomy revealed two large intraluminal calcified masses in the ileum, which were confirmed by infrared spectroscopy to be composed of bile acid.

Given the patient's history of bowel resection and the composition of the calculi, these findings are consistent with the formation of enteroliths, specifically bile acid enteroliths. Enteroliths can form in patients with altered bowel anatomy or motility, such as those with a history of Crohn's disease and surgical resections, due to stasis and changes in the composition of intestinal contents.

Final Diagnosis: Bile acid enteroliths in the ileum.",CORRECT,UNCOMMON,68
10.1016%j.cgh.2017.08.003,"patient_presentation: An 81-year-old woman was referred to our facility for the management of new onset dysphagia to solids.
additional_history: She had a history of oropharyngeal leukoplakia, which was being followed by ear, nose, and throat doctor. She had several medical comorbidities including ischemic heart disease with automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. She denied any tobacco or alcohol use. 
imaging_test_with_photo: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed narrowing of the proximal esophagus with characteristic white plaques suggestive of esophageal leukoplakia (Figure A). 
next_imaging: Endoscopic mucosal resection was performed, resulting in the successful removal of the lesion (Figure C).
third_imaging: A repeat endoscopy after 8 weeks showed near complete resolution of leukoplakia with no evidence of stricture (Figure D).",...suggestive of esophageal leukoplakia.,"Based on the information provided, the patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of oropharyngeal leukoplakia who presented with new onset dysphagia to solids. The esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed narrowing of the proximal esophagus with white plaques suggestive of esophageal leukoplakia. An endoscopic mucosal resection was performed, and a repeat endoscopy after 8 weeks showed near complete resolution of the leukoplakia with no evidence of stricture.

The presence of white plaques and narrowing in the esophagus, along with the history of oropharyngeal leukoplakia, suggests that the patient had esophageal leukoplakia. Leukoplakia is a condition characterized by white patches on mucous membranes, and in this case, it was affecting the esophagus. The successful endoscopic mucosal resection and subsequent resolution of the leukoplakia further support this diagnosis.

Final Diagnosis: Esophageal leukoplakia.",CORRECT,UNCOMMON,179
10.1016%j.cgh.2017.07.036,"patient_presentation: A 29-year-old woman with Crohn‚Äôs fistulizing ileocolitis presented for colonoscopy.
additional_history: During the previous 10 years, she had persistent loose stools and abdominal pain with mesalamine/prednisone, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, natalizumab, and then methotrexate. Each treatment was trialed sequentially for approximately 1 year before determining non-response. After 3 years of standard-dose ustekinumab therapy, the patient had fewer loose stools and less pain/bloating, but routine magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed active Crohn‚Äôs disease from the splenic flexure to the anus with possible stricture.
imaging_test_with_photo: Endoscopic evaluation showed nodular mucosa from 0 to 50 cm proximal to the anus, and this area was biopsied (Figure A).",...most consistent with plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL).,"Based on the provided information, the patient is a 29-year-old woman with a history of Crohn's disease, specifically fistulizing ileocolitis. Despite treatment with multiple biologics and immunosuppressants, she continues to have active disease. The endoscopic evaluation reveals nodular mucosa, and imaging indicates active disease from the splenic flexure to the anus with a possible stricture.

The presence of nodular mucosa and the history of fistulizing disease suggest ongoing active inflammation. The possible stricture noted on imaging could indicate fibrostenotic changes, which are common in Crohn's disease due to chronic inflammation leading to scarring and narrowing of the bowel.

Given these findings, the most accurate diagnosis is ongoing active Crohn's disease with complications including possible stricturing and fistulizing disease. This indicates that despite treatment, the patient has not achieved full remission and continues to have significant disease activity.

Final Diagnosis: Active Crohn's disease with possible stricturing and fistulizing complications.",INCORRECT,UNCOMMON,180
10.1016%j.cgh.2018.05.052,"patient_presentation: A 63-year-old woman with cirrhosis was transferred to our medical facility for higher-level care after outside hospitalization for dizziness, nausea, and right upper-quadrant pain.
additional_history: On arrival, she additionally reported nonbloody emesis, epigastric pain, and early satiety with postprandial discomfort. 
imaging_test_with_photo: The patient underwent oral endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) for a yellowish 4-cm submucosal tumor at the gastric body with a positive pillow sign (Figure A).
next_imaging: On EUS, a vascular structure appeared at the bulge that was highly suggestive of a splenic artery aneurysm (SAA) based on Doppler readout (Figures B and C). Because the vessel appeared to originate from the splenic hilum and did not breach the submucosal space, varices were ruled out in favor of gastric extraluminal compression by SAA.
third_imaging: Concordantly, magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple short fusiform SAAs at the hilum up to 1.8 cm in diameter (Figure D). The splenic artery was patent despite thrombus occlusion proximally, and moderate splenomegaly was recorded at 16.5 cm.","A surgical consult concluded that the small SSA was unlikely to be the cause of abdominal pain, and intervention was deemed unnecessary.",Final Diagnosis: Splenic Artery Aneurysm (SAA) causing gastric extraluminal compression.,CORRECT,COMMON,66
10.1016%j.cgh.2018.01.043,"patient_presentation: An 84-year-old woman presented with 2-days of epigastric pain accompanied by nausea and coffee-ground emesis.
physical_exam: Physical examination revealed mild tenderness in the epigastrium and a succussion splash.
imaging_test_with_photo: Computed tomography of the abdomen demonstrated findings consistent with a gastric outlet obstruction and a large irregular fluid and gas-filled collection centered on the first and second portions of the duodenum (Figure A, arrow).
next_imaging: On esophagogastroduodenoscopy, a fistula was found in the gastric antrum (Figure B) with evidence of a large gallstone within the fistula tract (Figure C).
third_imaging: Electrohydraulic lithotripsy was performed along with stenting of the fistula under fluoroscopic guidance to prevent further stone impaction (Figure D) and a nasojejunal (NJ) feeding tube was placed for nutritional support. ",...findings consistent with a gastric outlet obstruction and a large irregular fluid and gas-filled collection centered on the first and second portions of the duodenum...evidence of a large gallstone within the fistula tract,"Based on the provided information, the patient, an 84-year-old woman, presents with epigastric pain, nausea, and coffee-ground emesis. The physical exam shows mild epigastric tenderness and a succussion splash, which suggests gastric outlet obstruction. The CT scan findings are consistent with this diagnosis and show a large irregular fluid and gas-filled collection in the duodenum.

The esophagogastroduodenoscopy reveals a fistula in the gastric antrum with a large gallstone within the fistula tract. This presentation is characteristic of a condition known as gallstone ileus, where a gallstone erodes through the gallbladder into the gastrointestinal tract, creating a cholecystenteric fistula. The stone then causes obstruction, which in this case is at the gastric outlet.

The management involved electrohydraulic lithotripsy to break down the gallstone and stenting of the fistula to prevent further stone impaction, along with nutritional support via a nasojejunal feeding tube.

Final Diagnosis: Gallstone ileus with gastric outlet obstruction due to a cholecystogastric fistula.",CORRECT,UNCOMMON,112
10.1016%j.cgh.2018.03.035,"patient_presentation: An 83-year-old man presented two years earlier with iron deficiency anemia.
additional_history: The patient tolerated chemotherapy for two years but re-presented to our care with symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction. An upper endoscopy revealed a malignant appearing antral ulcer that did not involve the pylorus. Cross-sectional imaging showed metastatic disease to peri-gastric lymph nodes and the peritoneum.
imaging_test_with_photo: Computed tomography/position emissions tomography showed just focal disease at the pylorus (yellow arrow) with a distended stomach and an air-fluid level (red arrow, A).
next_imaging: On endoscopy, malignant pyloric stenosis was observed that was focal in nature (B).
third_imaging: The decision was made to place a 15 mm lumen-apposing metal stent given the focal disease, the need for a short stent that would not migrate, and the barbell shape that would help prevent migration with continued chemotherapy (C). The stent was placed successfully under endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance over a wire.",Malignant pyloric stenosis,"Based on the provided details, the patient is an 83-year-old man with a history of iron deficiency anemia, who underwent chemotherapy for two years. He presented with symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction. An upper endoscopy revealed a malignant antral ulcer, and imaging showed metastatic disease to peri-gastric lymph nodes and the peritoneum. The CT/PET scan indicated focal disease at the pylorus with a distended stomach and an air-fluid level. Endoscopy confirmed malignant pyloric stenosis. A lumen-apposing metal stent was placed to address the obstruction.

The clinical presentation, endoscopic findings, and imaging results are consistent with a diagnosis of gastric cancer, specifically an advanced gastric adenocarcinoma with pyloric stenosis and metastatic spread.

10.1016%j.cgh.2019.09.047,"patient_presentation: A 58-year-old woman with a past medical hsitory of hypertension was referred for resection of a lesion seen on recent colonoscopy in the termianl ileum near the ileocecal valve. 
additional_history: Her symptoms were notable for intermittent abdominal pain associated with nausea. The decision was made to resect the lesion. To prepare for mucosal resection, a colloidal lifting solution and epineprhine was injected to raise the lesion at the base....The patient was discharged home wtih no complications. Two weeks following the procedure, the patient reported resolution of presenting symptoms.
imaging_test_with_photo: The colonoscopy was performed, and a large polypoid pedunculated lesion was seen prolapsing from the  terminal ileum into the cecum (Figure A).
next_imaging: Snare mucosal resection was successfully performed (Figure B).",Here we present an unusual location of an alimentary tract lipoma.,"Based on the information provided, the patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of hypertension who presented with intermittent abdominal pain and nausea. A colonoscopy revealed a large polypoid pedunculated lesion prolapsing from the terminal ileum into the cecum. The lesion was successfully resected using a snare mucosal resection, and the patient experienced resolution of symptoms following the procedure.

The presentation of a polypoid lesion in the terminal ileum near the ileocecal valve is suggestive of a benign lesion, such as a lipoma or a benign adenomatous polyp. However, the resolution of symptoms following resection and the description of the lesion as ""polypoid"" and ""pedunculated"" are consistent with a benign adenomatous polyp.

10.1016%j.cgh.2018.03.019,"patient_presentation: Here we describe an 88-year-old woman with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension presenting wtih severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
physical_exam: Physical exam revealed an afebrile woman with right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness without peritoneal signs. Her abdomen was distended and tympanic with diminished bowel sounds.
imaging_test_with_photo: Initial x-ray suggested free air beneath the right hemidiaphgram, as noted in image A, concerning for pneumoperitoneum.
next_imaging: Computed tomography (CT) scan was obtained which showed a severely distended right colon caught between the liver and right hemidiaphragm, as in image B and C.","This is termed Chilaiditi sign, a right colonic volvulus that was impinged between the liver and right hemidiaphragm without evidence of an intestinal perforation","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 88-year-old woman with a history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, presenting with severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The physical exam shows right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness, abdominal distention, and diminished bowel sounds. The initial x-ray suggests free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm, indicating pneumoperitoneum. The CT scan reveals a severely distended right colon positioned between the liver and right hemidiaphragm.

These findings are consistent with a condition known as Chilaiditi syndrome, which occurs when a loop of the bowel, usually the colon, is interposed between the liver and the diaphragm. This can sometimes mimic pneumoperitoneum on x-ray due to the presence of air in the bowel loop, but the CT scan clarifies the situation by showing the distended colon.

10.1053%j.gastro.2020.01.038,"patient_presentation: A 70-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with 3 weeks of melena and one recent episode of coffee ground vomiting on a background of intermittent abdominal pain, anorexia and weight loss of 5 kilograms over the preceding three months. 
additional_history: Her other medical history was significant for atrial fibrillation treated with apixaban as well as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. She was hemodynamically stable and had mild epigastric tenderness with no features of peritonism.
physical_exam: Digital rectal examination confirmed melena.
initial_laboratory_results: Initial laboratory values showed normocytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 6.0g/dL, urea of 37.2mg/dL, creatinine of 1.09mg/dL and liver function tests within the normal range.
imaging_test_with_photo: A gastroscopy was performed, which demonstrated a large, solid, incompressible spherical object in the first part of the duodenum with associated semicircumferential mucosal ulceration but no active bleeding (Figure A and Figure B).
next_imaging: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen was performed after the gastroscopy, with axial (Figure C) and coronal (Figure D) images shown.",Large gallstone in the duodenum causing partial obstruction and mucosal ulceration,"Based on the provided information, the patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of melena, coffee ground vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia, and significant weight loss. Her medical history includes atrial fibrillation treated with apixaban, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. The physical examination and laboratory results indicate normocytic anemia with a significantly low hemoglobin level. The gastroscopy revealed a large, solid, incompressible spherical object in the first part of the duodenum with associated semicircumferential mucosal ulceration but no active bleeding. 

The presence of a spherical object in the duodenum with associated ulceration suggests the possibility of a bezoar or a foreign body causing obstruction and ulceration. The patient's symptoms of gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, and weight loss could be attributed to the ulceration caused by this object. The CT scan would likely provide further confirmation of the nature of the object.

Given the clinical presentation and gastroscopy findings, the most likely diagnosis is a duodenal bezoar, which is a mass of undigested material causing obstruction and ulceration in the gastrointestinal tract.

10.1016%j.cgh.2018.02.003,"patient_presentation: An 81-year-old man presented with a brutal upper abdominal pain, malaise, sweating and vomiting.
imaging_test_with_photo: Upper GI endoscopcy confirmed the presence of gallstone in the duodenum (A) and identified the cholecystoduodenal fistula next to the cystic duct (B). Unfortunately, several mechanical removal techniques including Dormia (Endo-flex) and Baskets (Boston), duodenal balloon dilatation, cap aspiration, twister net and captivator failed, partially due to the rounded shape of the biliary stone. 
next_imaging: Endoscopic lithotripsy (Siemens Lithoskop) was then performed by drilling a hole through the biliary stone which allowed insertion of a guide-wire inside the tunnel thus created (C). Trying to widen the tunnel with a Soehendra biliary dilatation balloon, allowed only partial fragmentation of the stone.
third_imaging: A complete biliary stone fragmentation was eventually achieved with laser lithotripsy (D).",Computed tomography revealed an important distension of both the stomach and the first portion of the duodenum consistent with intestinal obstruction as well as a 3cm biliary stone in the second portion of the duodenum.,"Based on the provided information, the patient is an 81-year-old man presenting with severe upper abdominal pain, malaise, sweating, and vomiting. The imaging and endoscopic findings reveal a gallstone in the duodenum and a cholecystoduodenal fistula. The presence of a gallstone in the duodenum, along with the fistula, suggests that the gallstone has migrated from the gallbladder into the gastrointestinal tract through the fistula.

The condition described is consistent with gallstone ileus, a rare form of bowel obstruction caused by a gallstone entering the intestinal tract through a fistula, most commonly a cholecystoduodenal fistula. In this case, the gallstone was located in the duodenum, which is a less common site for obstruction but can cause significant symptoms as described.

10.1016%j.cgh.2018.08.013,"patient_presentation: A 73-year-old man was admitted for health care-associated bilateral pneumonia and was treated with piperacillin/tazobactam.
additional_history: No mibrobiological agent was identified. Past medical history was relevant for 2 recent and long hospital admissions for severe depression with psychotic symptoms. The patient continued to refuse food and weight loss persisted despite resolution of pneumonia.
imaging_test_with_photo: An upper digestive endoscopy was performed and the examination showed numerous scattered and coalescing white plaques in the distal two thirds of the esophagus (Figure A).","The lesions were suggestive of esophageal candidiasis and therefore fluconazola was prescribed. However, the biopsy specimens showed ulcerated esophagitis and the presence of herpes viral inclusions.","Based on the information provided, the patient is a 73-year-old man who has been treated for health care-associated bilateral pneumonia with piperacillin/tazobactam. Despite the resolution of pneumonia, he continues to refuse food and experiences weight loss. An upper digestive endoscopy reveals numerous scattered and coalescing white plaques in the distal two-thirds of the esophagus.

The presence of white plaques in the esophagus is highly suggestive of esophageal candidiasis, especially in a patient who has been hospitalized and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, which can disrupt normal flora and predispose to fungal infections. Additionally, the patient's refusal to eat and weight loss could be due to odynophagia (painful swallowing) associated with esophageal candidiasis.
