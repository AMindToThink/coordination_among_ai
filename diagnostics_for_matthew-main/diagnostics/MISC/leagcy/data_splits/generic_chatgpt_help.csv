He has no other significant symptoms, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, hematemesis, melena, or weight loss. His laboratory results show mild anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.6 g/dL, but normal platelet count and coagulation profile. Imaging studies, including CT scans, are normal. Colonoscopy reveals variable lesions throughout the colorectum, including patchy, yellow-red, plaque-like lesions, submucosal hematomas, ulcerations, and polypoid protrusions.

The colonoscopy findings are suggestive of a condition known as ""colonic amyloidosis."" Amyloidosis can cause patchy, plaque-like lesions and submucosal hematomas due to amyloid deposits in the bowel wall, leading to vascular fragility and bleeding. The presence of polypoid protrusions and ulcerations can also be seen in amyloidosis. The negative serum and urine tests for monoclonal proteins suggest that this may not be related to a plasma cell dyscrasia, such as multiple myeloma, which is consistent with primary (AL) amyloidosis or secondary (AA) amyloidosis. However, the absence of systemic symptoms and normal imaging might suggest a localized form of amyloidosis.

10.1053%j.gastro.2010.01.066,"patient_presentation: A 31-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of acute onset of hematochezia.
additional_history: He reported to have colicky abdominal pain 4 hours before the onset of hematochezia. He had similar attack for 4 times in the previous 10 years. Repeated upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, computed tomography (CT), and angiography all failed to identify the bleeder. Like this attack, he recalled the previous bleeding episodes were precipitated with lower abdominal colicky abdominal pain and were self-limited after conservative treatment. Two episodes of hematochezia with hypovolemic shock occurred within 2 hours after admission. He was then transferred to the intensive care unit with fluid resuscitation.
imaging_without_photo: Emergent CT angiography disclosed only blood clots in the colon.
imaging_test_with_photo: A double-balloon enteroscopy found the presence of a lesion during anal route examination (Figure A; Video A).
next_imaging: A tattoo was done for subsequent laparoscopic resection of the lesion (Figure B; Video B).",Meckel's diverticulum,"Based on the provided information, the patient is a 31-year-old man with recurrent episodes of hematochezia and colicky abdominal pain. Despite multiple diagnostic tests, including upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, CT, and angiography, the source of bleeding had not been identified until a double-balloon enteroscopy was performed. This enteroscopy identified a lesion in the small bowel, which was subsequently tattooed for laparoscopic resection.

The recurrent nature of the bleeding episodes, the location of the lesion in the small bowel, and the failure of standard diagnostic tests to identify the source until a specialized enteroscopy was performed suggest a diagnosis of a vascular lesion in the small intestine. The most common type of such a lesion, particularly in a young patient with recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, is a small bowel arteriovenous malformation or angiodysplasia.

third_imaging: Post-procedure, computed tomography was obtained to evaluate the umbilical hernia and revealed edematous, hyperemeic small bowel in the hernia sac and proximal bowel dilation (c).","Given the patient likely had liver disease for many years but had never experienced bleeding, it was postulated that the strangulated bowel likely led to acutely increased intra-abdominal and portal venous pressures, thus resulting in variceal hemorrhage.","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 47-year-old man with Laennec‚Äôs cirrhosis who presented with acute mid-abdominal pain and hematemesis. The physical examination indicates an ill-appearing male with signs of liver disease (scleral icterus) and a tender, warm, discolored umbilical hernia. The esophagogastroduodenoscopy findings of large esophageal varices with a ""white nipple sign"" suggest recent or active bleeding from the varices, which is a common complication of portal hypertension due to cirrhosis.

The computed tomography findings show edematous, hyperemic small bowel in the hernia sac and proximal bowel dilation, indicating a strangulated umbilical hernia with bowel obstruction. This is a surgical emergency and explains the acute abdominal pain.

Given these findings, the patient is suffering from complications of cirrhosis, including portal hypertension leading to esophageal varices and a strangulated umbilical hernia causing bowel obstruction and ischemia.

next_imaging: Endoscopic ultrasonography was done and as the pancreatic duct was followed towards the head of pancreas it showed a hyperechoic structure (5.3 ",Obstructive Jaundice Owing to Dead Worm in Common Channel,"Based on the provided information, the 3-year-old boy presents with upper abdominal pain, high-grade fever, and jaundice. The laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), elevated alkaline phosphatase, and elevated bilirubin levels, which suggest liver dysfunction and possible obstruction. The elevated amylase and lipase levels indicate pancreatic involvement.

The abdominal ultrasonography shows a dilated common bile duct and pancreatic duct, with an ill-defined hyperechoic shadow near the lower end of the common bile duct. The magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic ultrasound reveal a hyperechoic structure inside the pancreatic duct, which is not causing an acoustic shadow.

These findings are suggestive of a condition causing obstruction of the bile duct and pancreatic duct. The presence of a hyperechoic structure in the pancreatic duct without acoustic shadowing suggests a possible stone or sludge. The dilated common bile duct and pancreatic duct, along with the symptoms, are consistent with choledochal cyst or pancreaticobiliary maljunction, which can lead to recurrent pancreatitis and obstructive jaundice.

Given the tropical setting and the socioeconomic status, parasitic infections such as ascariasis or clonorchiasis could also be considered, but the imaging findings are more consistent with a structural anomaly.

physical_exam: Vital signs were within normal range. Physical examination revealed a thin, jaundiced man with sclearl icterus, a non-tender distended abdomen with positive shifting dullness, caput medusae, and pitting lower extremity edema.
initial_laboratory_results: Laboratory tests showed thrombocytopenia and a predominately cholestatic pattern of liver test abnormalities with a total bilirubin of 6.1 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase of 481 U/L, AST of 129 U/L, ATL of 84 U/L, and albumin of 2.8 g/dL.  
imaging_without_photo: Surface nodularity of the shrunken liver and prominent biliary dilation were seen on an abdominal ultrasound. On endoscopic ultrasound, the ampulla appeared normal with no evidence of an obstructing mass lesion, biliary stricture, or choledocholithiasis. Subsequent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was notable for thick mucin filling the bile ducts.
imaging_test_with_photo: Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed severe diffuse dilation of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts (Figure A). 
next_imaging: Cholangioscopy demonstrated normal biliary epithelium except for a small focus of villous, frond-like mucosa in the left hepatic duct (Figure B).",papillary structure with a fibrovascular core lined by mucinous epithelium consistent with intraductal Papillary Neoplasm of the Bile Duct (IPNB),"Based on the information provided, the patient's symptoms and test results suggest a specific condition. The patient has a history of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), which is a risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma and other biliary tract abnormalities. The progressive jaundice, abdominal distension, and lower extremity edema are indicative of liver dysfunction and possible complications such as portal hypertension and ascites.

The laboratory results show a cholestatic pattern of liver injury, with elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels, and low albumin, which is consistent with liver dysfunction and possibly advanced liver disease. The imaging studies reveal surface nodularity of the liver, which suggests cirrhosis, and prominent biliary dilation, which is unusual in PSC unless there is a secondary process.

The key finding from the cholangioscopy is the presence of a small focus of villous, frond-like mucosa in the left hepatic duct. This finding is highly suggestive of intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct (IPNB), which can produce thick mucin and lead to biliary obstruction and dilation. The presence of thick mucin filling the bile ducts, as noted during the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, supports this diagnosis.

Given the patient's history, symptoms, and the specific findings on cholangioscopy, the most likely diagnosis is intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the bile duct.

He presented with diarrhea, high fever, and was found to have significantly elevated C-reactive protein, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels, indicating a systemic inflammatory response and renal impairment.

The colonoscopy revealed redness and edematous mucosa at the terminal ileum and the total colon, which suggests colitis. The CT scan showed a distended abdominal aorta, which had increased in size since the first admission, indicating a possible aneurysm or infection.

The combination of gastrointestinal symptoms, systemic inflammation, and aortic dilation suggests a possible diagnosis of infectious aortitis or a mycotic aneurysm, which could be due to a bacterial infection that has spread to the aorta, potentially from the gastrointestinal tract or another source.

The administration of intravenous levofloxacin, an antibiotic, and subsequent surgery, followed by discharge, further supports the possibility of an infectious process that required surgical intervention.

The laboratory tests are largely unremarkable, and there are no signs of infection or significant inflammation (as indicated by the normal white cell count). The imaging studies reveal gallbladder wall thickening and a 5 cm hyperechoic or hyperintense lesion inside the gallbladder.

The positive Murphy's sign, along with the gallbladder wall thickening and the presence of a lesion, suggests a gallbladder-related issue. The hyperechoic lesion could represent a gallstone, but given the size (5 cm), it is more likely to be a gallbladder polyp or possibly a gallbladder carcinoma. Gallstones are typically not this large, and a gallbladder polyp of this size raises concern for malignancy.

Considering the patient's age, the presence of a large lesion, and the symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is gallbladder carcinoma. Gallbladder cancer can present with these symptoms and imaging findings, especially in the presence of a large lesion within the gallbladder.

third_imaging: During exploratory laparotomy, a perforated wide-based Meckel's diverticulum within a segment of inflamed terminal ileum was discovered and resected (Figure C).",Iatrogenic immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorder,"Based on the provided information, the patient's symptoms and findings can be attributed to a combination of Crohn's disease complications and an additional pathology. The patient has a history of Crohn's disease, which can cause ileitis and bowel thickening, as seen in the CT enterography. The colonoscopy findings of ulcerated terminal ileum and partially obstructing masses with atypical large B cell infiltrate suggest the presence of a lymphoproliferative disorder, likely related to the patient's immunosuppressive therapy (adalimumab and azathioprine). This could be indicative of a post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) or a lymphoma, such as a large B-cell lymphoma.

The exploratory laparotomy revealed a perforated wide-based Meckel's diverticulum within the inflamed terminal ileum. Meckel's diverticulum can sometimes mimic or coexist with Crohn's disease and can lead to complications such as perforation, especially in the context of inflammation.

Therefore, the final diagnosis is a combination of Crohn's disease with complications, including a perforated Meckel's diverticulum and a likely lymphoma (atypical large B cell infiltrate) due to immunosuppression.

The upper endoscopy was negative for ulcers or gastritis, and the colonoscopy showed diverticulosis but no active bleeding.

The key findings here are the iron-deficiency anemia and the positive fecal occult blood test (guaiac-positive stool), which suggest gastrointestinal blood loss. The negative findings on endoscopy and colonoscopy for active bleeding or significant lesions like ulcers or tumors make the source of bleeding less obvious.

Diverticulosis itself typically does not cause iron-deficiency anemia unless there is active bleeding, which was not observed during the colonoscopy. However, diverticulosis can sometimes lead to intermittent bleeding that might not be caught during the procedure.

Given the patient's age and presentation, one must consider the possibility of a gastrointestinal malignancy that might not have been detected during the procedures. A common cause of occult gastrointestinal bleeding in this age group is a colorectal cancer, which might have been missed if it is small or located in a difficult-to-visualize area.

Considering the information provided and the common causes of such presentations, the most likely diagnosis is a gastrointestinal malignancy, such as a colorectal cancer, that was not detected during the initial evaluations. Further investigations, such as a repeat colonoscopy, capsule endoscopy, or imaging studies, might be necessary to identify the source of bleeding.

The abdominal ultrasound revealed an intrahepatic cyst, and further imaging with MRCP and ERCP showed a cyst with a separate duct draining into the common hepatic duct.

The combination of these findings, particularly the presence of a cyst with a separate duct draining into the common hepatic duct, is suggestive of a choledochal cyst. Choledochal cysts are congenital dilations of the bile duct, and they can present with symptoms similar to those described, including abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

These findings are highly suggestive of a vascular lesion in the colon, specifically a type of vascular malformation or tumor. The description of the colonoscopic findings as a ""conglomerated grape-like shape"" with ""hemocystic spots"" is characteristic of a venous malformation or a vascular tumor such as a cavernous hemangioma. These lesions can cause significant bleeding, leading to hematochezia and anemia.

Her medical history is notable for breast augmentation, and she has been in the United States for many years. The physical examination shows wasting, and laboratory results reveal significant transaminitis, hypoalbuminemia, anemia, and elevated inflammatory markers. Hepatitis serologies are negative.

The imaging findings are crucial in this case. The esophagram shows a massively dilated esophagus with a ""bird beak"" appearance, which is characteristic of achalasia. This diagnosis is further confirmed by esophageal manometry. Additionally, the CT scan shows a dilated esophagus and multiple mediastinal lymph nodes.

The combination of achalasia with significant inflammation, as indicated by elevated CRP and ESR, and the presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy, raises suspicion for a secondary cause of achalasia, such as a paraneoplastic syndrome or an infectious cause like Chagas disease. However, given the patient's long-term residence in the United States and lack of recent travel to endemic areas, Chagas disease is less likely.

The wasting noted on physical examination, along with the significant laboratory abnormalities, suggests a systemic process. The presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy could indicate a paraneoplastic process, such as a malignancy causing pseudoachalasia. However, there is no direct evidence of a tumor on the CT scan, and the patient's young age and pregnancy make malignancy less likely.

Considering all the information, the most likely diagnosis is primary achalasia, possibly exacerbated by pregnancy-related changes and systemic inflammation. The mediastinal lymphadenopathy could be reactive or related to another inflammatory or infectious process that is not directly causing the achalasia.

imaging_without_photo: Abdominal radiography demonstrated dilated small bowels with air‚Äìfluid levels.
imaging_test_with_photo: Computed tomography (CT) of the dilated small bowels revealed a tight thick cord projection (Figure A, thick arrow) from the intestinal wall (Figure A, arrow head) toward the retroperitoneum with edematous mesentery (Figure A, thin arrow).",Bowel strangulation by Meckel's diverticulum,"Based on the information provided, the patient is a 62-year-old man with acute mid-abdominal pain and vomiting, elevated white blood cell count, and imaging findings. The abdominal radiography shows dilated small bowels with air-fluid levels, suggesting a small bowel obstruction. The CT scan reveals a ""tight thick cord projection"" from the intestinal wall toward the retroperitoneum with an edematous mesentery.

These findings are highly suggestive of a small bowel obstruction due to a volvulus, particularly a midgut volvulus. The ""tight thick cord projection"" could represent the twisted segment of bowel or a band causing the volvulus, and the edematous mesentery indicates compromised blood flow, which is common in volvulus due to the twisting of the mesentery.

imaging_test_with_photo: The colonoscopy showed an ulcerated tumor occupying three quarters of the circumference of the lumen in the transverse colon (Figure A) and a 30-mm polypoid tumor in the ascending colon (Figure B).
next_imaging: After 5 cycles, colonoscopy was repeated and no lesions were observed, except a scar in the transverse colon (Figure C).","Biopsy specimens showed a poorly differentiated solid carcinoma and immunohistochemistry showed a TTF1 and Napsin-A–positive tumor, which favors metastatic tumors from a pulmonary origin.","Based on the information provided, the patient is a 72-year-old man with a history of pulmonary obstructive disease and a significant history of smoking. He presented with hematochezia, weight loss, and abdominal pain, which are concerning symptoms for a possible malignancy in the colon. The colonoscopy revealed an ulcerated tumor in the transverse colon and a polypoid tumor in the ascending colon. After treatment, a repeat colonoscopy showed no lesions, only a scar in the transverse colon, suggesting a response to treatment.

The presentation is highly suggestive of colorectal cancer, particularly given the ulcerated nature of the tumor and the patient's symptoms. The response to treatment, with no lesions observed on follow-up colonoscopy, further supports this diagnosis, as it indicates that the lesions were likely malignant and responded to therapy.

initial_laboratory_results: Laboratory test results showed iron-deficiency anemia. 
imaging_test_with_photo: Duodenoscopy showed a 1.5-cm pedunculated mass at the ampulla of Vater. The mass was tense and covered with a normal mucosa (Figure A).
next_imaging: A biopsy specimen from the erosion at the tumor neck (Figure B, arrowhead) showed normal ampullary tissue and thus did not confirm the diagnosis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and intraductal ultrasonography showed no tumor progression into the pancreatic and bile ducts. The mass was found to be limited to the ampulla. Endoscopic papillectomy was performed to ensure a correct diagnosis.",The histopathologic diagnosis was myoepithelial hamartoma.,"Based on the provided information, the patient is a 63-year-old man with iron-deficiency anemia, and imaging has revealed a 1.5-cm pedunculated mass at the ampulla of Vater. The biopsy from the erosion at the tumor neck showed normal ampullary tissue, and there was no evidence of tumor progression into the pancreatic and bile ducts. An endoscopic papillectomy was performed to ensure a correct diagnosis.

The presence of a pedunculated mass at the ampulla of Vater, combined with iron-deficiency anemia, raises suspicion for a possible ampullary adenoma or early-stage ampullary carcinoma. These lesions can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, leading to anemia. The fact that the biopsy showed normal ampullary tissue suggests that the biopsy may not have sampled the lesion adequately, which is why an endoscopic papillectomy was performed for a more definitive diagnosis.

Considering these factors, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is an ampullary adenoma, which is a benign tumor that can potentially transform into an ampullary carcinoma if not treated.

physical_exam: On physical examination, diffuse abdominal tenderness and shifting dullness were observed.
initial_laboratory_results: Laboratory results showed a white-cell count of 11,400 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 4000 to 9500) and total bilirubin of 42.1 Œºmol/L (reference range, 0.00 to 20.5). 
imaging_without_photo: A positron emission tomography (PET) scan was performed, showing irregular thickening of the small bowel and colon accompanied with FDG hypermetabolism of spleen, liver, abdominal lymph nodes and bone marrow. 
imaging_test_with_photo: Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed diffuse and irregular cystic lesions in the left liver (Figure A). 
next_imaging: The coronal plane of abdominal CT showed enlarged left liver occupying most of the abdominal cavity (Figure B). ",This patient was diagnosed as polycystic liver disease (PLD) with hepatic cyst infection and classified as severe phenotype (Gigot Type III).,"Based on the information provided, the patient is a 45-year-old woman with a 15-day history of abdominal pain and distention. The physical examination shows diffuse abdominal tenderness and shifting dullness, which suggests ascites. The laboratory results indicate leukocytosis (elevated white-cell count) and hyperbilirubinemia (elevated total bilirubin). The PET scan shows irregular thickening of the small bowel and colon with FDG hypermetabolism in the spleen, liver, abdominal lymph nodes, and bone marrow, suggesting a systemic process with high metabolic activity, possibly malignancy. The abdominal CT scan reveals diffuse and irregular cystic lesions in the left liver and an enlarged left liver occupying most of the abdominal cavity.

The combination of these findings suggests a diagnosis of a neoplastic process involving the liver and possibly other organs. The irregular cystic lesions in the liver, along with the systemic involvement seen on PET scan, raise suspicion for a primary hepatic malignancy with metastatic spread or a hematological malignancy with liver involvement.

Considering the patient's age, symptoms, imaging findings, and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is a type of lymphoma, such as hepatic lymphoma or another aggressive lymphoma with extranodal involvement. The FDG hypermetabolism in multiple organs and the presence of diffuse cystic liver lesions are consistent with this diagnosis.

The esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a flat depressed lesion in the middle of the thoracic esophagus, which appeared as a brownish area on narrow-band imaging.

The combination of these findings suggests a malignancy, likely esophageal cancer, with possible metastasis to the lymph nodes and bones. The flat depressed lesion in the esophagus is characteristic of an early esophageal cancer, and the systemic FDG uptake is indicative of metastatic spread.

10.1053%j.gastro.2018.06.085,"patient_presentation: A 69-year-old woman was referred to our clinic for control colonoscopy after endoscopic resection of a rectal adenoma with low-grade dysplasia.
imaging_without_photo: A colonoscopy was then carried out, because the investigation of colon and rectum was unremarkable. While interrogating the terminal ileum, subepithelial dark and diffuse flecks were detected along 15 cm with normal appearing epithelium.
imaging_test_with_photo: These dark areas had patchy distribution and were surrounded by normal appearing mucosa (Figure A, B).",Melanosis coli owing to black licorice-flavored candies,"Based on the information provided, the patient is a 69-year-old woman who underwent a control colonoscopy after having a rectal adenoma with low-grade dysplasia removed. The colonoscopy was unremarkable for the colon and rectum, but during the examination of the terminal ileum, subepithelial dark and diffuse flecks were detected over a 15 cm area, with normal-appearing epithelium. These dark areas had a patchy distribution and were surrounded by normal mucosa.

The findings of subepithelial dark flecks in the terminal ileum with normal mucosa could be indicative of a condition known as ""pseudomelanosis ilei."" This is a rare, benign condition characterized by the presence of pigment-laden macrophages in the lamina propria of the ileum, giving rise to the appearance of dark spots or flecks under the epithelium. It is often an incidental finding during endoscopy and is not associated with any significant clinical symptoms or adverse outcomes. The exact cause is not well understood, but it has been associated with the use of certain medications (such as iron supplements or antihypertensives) and chronic renal failure.

Given the description of the findings and the lack of any other significant abnormalities or symptoms, pseudomelanosis ilei is the most likely diagnosis.

10.1016%j.cgh.2015.08.007,"patient_presentation: A 59-year-old man with a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea and no relevant familly history for colorectal cancer underwent screening colonoscopy.
physical_exam: Several large diverticula were found in the sigmoid colon. At 30 cm from the anal verge, 2 adjacent inverted diverticula were found.
imaging_test_with_photo: A second procedure was scheduled in which gentle cold snare polypectomy was attempted (Figure A). However, the lesion could not be resected, probably the result of entrapment of the tip of the ICD by the snare. Diathermy was not used because of the high risk of perforation in this setting.
next_imaging: Hence, resection using the ligate-and-let-go technique was planned because it enables a slow mechanical transction of the diverticulum with a much lower risk of perforation. A standard detachable snare (MAJ-254; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) was positioned and tightened around the base of the ICD, resulting in its immediate congestion (Figure B). Submucosal tattooing was performed distally to the second ICD.
third_imaging: A follow-up colonoscopy was performed 8 weeks later that showed a regular scar without residual lesion (Figure C) and negative biopsy samples.","In the tip of the most proximal inverted colonic diverticulum (ICD), a 10-mm flat adenomatous transformation (type 0-IIa in the Paris classification) was suspected.","The information provided describes a case involving a 59-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea. During a screening colonoscopy, several large diverticula were found in the sigmoid colon, including two adjacent inverted diverticula (ICD) at 30 cm from the anal verge.

The initial attempt to resect the inverted diverticula using a cold snare polypectomy was unsuccessful due to the entrapment of the tip of the ICD by the snare, and diathermy was avoided to reduce the risk of perforation. Subsequently, the ""ligate-and-let-go"" technique was employed, which involved using a detachable snare to cause congestion and eventual transection of the diverticulum. Follow-up colonoscopy 8 weeks later showed a regular scar without any residual lesion, and biopsy samples were negative.

The key points here are the presence of inverted diverticula and the successful management using a non-invasive technique. The follow-up results indicate that there is no remaining lesion or malignancy.

imaging_test_with_photo: Given the size of the cyst, an endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration was scheduled for evaluation. On endoscopic ultrasound, a 4-cm anechoic and septated lesion consistent with a cyst was seen in the body of the pancreas (Figure A).
next_imaging: The cyst was first punctured with a 19-gauge fine-needle aspiration needle and a microbiopsy forceps was used to biopsy the wall of the cyst. Next, cyst fluid was aspirated in the usual manner. To our surprise, 5 mL of chylous fluid was aspirated (Figure B). The fluid results were as follows: 317 U/L amylase, 2.3 ng/mL carcinoembryonic antigen, 2670 mg/dL triglycerides, and 5 g/dL protein. ",The fluid appearance and the triglyceride level were diagnostic of a benign pancreatic lymphangioma (PL).,"Based on the information provided, the patient has a 4-cm cyst in the body of the pancreas that was found to contain chylous fluid upon aspiration. The fluid analysis shows:

- Amylase: 317 U/L
- Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA): 2.3 ng/mL
- Triglycerides: 2670 mg/dL
- Protein: 5 g/dL

The presence of chylous fluid with very high triglyceride levels is indicative of a lymphatic origin. The low CEA level suggests that the cyst is not likely to be a mucinous cystic neoplasm, which typically shows higher CEA levels.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is a pancreatic lymphoepithelial cyst. These cysts are rare, benign lesions of the pancreas that can contain chylous fluid due to their lymphatic connection. The high triglyceride content in the aspirated fluid is characteristic of these lesions.

Notably, these findings improved following the initiation of steroid therapy.

Given this clinical scenario, the patient's symptoms and endoscopic findings are consistent with immune-mediated enteritis, a known adverse effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors such as nivolumab. The improvement of the mucosal lesions with steroid therapy further supports this diagnosis.

The symptoms of abdominal pain, loose stools, and bright red blood per rectum, along with CT findings, suggest ischemic colitis in the sigmoid colon. The incidental finding of a submucosal polypoid lesion in the ileum, confirmed by both video capsule endoscopy and double-balloon enteroscopy, suggests a separate condition. The characteristics of the polypoid lesion (smooth, firm, submucosal) are consistent with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) or possibly a lipoma, but given the size and description, a GIST is more likely.
