imaging_test_with_photo: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with magnifying system showed villous atrophy and scalloping of the duodenum (Figure A-B); however, biopsy samples were non-diagnostic.
next_imaging: Enteroscopy showed villous atrophy and scalloping of the duodenum and jejunum (Figure C)...","IgA of anti-transglutaminase antibody was negative, we therefore made a diagnosis of olmesartan-associated sprue-like enteropathy (OASLE).","Based on the information provided, the patient is a 72-year-old woman who is taking olmesartan for hypertension and presents with chronic diarrhea and hypoproteinemia. The imaging studies, including esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and enteroscopy, show villous atrophy and scalloping of the duodenum and jejunum.

These findings are suggestive of a condition known as ""Olmesartan-associated enteropathy."" Olmesartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker used for hypertension, has been associated with a sprue-like enteropathy that can cause symptoms such as chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and malabsorption, leading to hypoproteinemia. The villous atrophy and scalloping seen on endoscopy are characteristic of this condition, although biopsy samples might be non-diagnostic or show non-specific changes.

10.1016%j.cgh.2017.09.026,"patient_presentation: A 58-year-old man visited our hospital because of a positive fecal occult blood test.
additional_history: He did not complain of any symptom.
physical_exam: Physical findings were unremarkable.
initial_laboratory_results: Laboratory tests were unremarkable.
imaging_test_with_photo: Colonoscopic examination showed polypoid lesions on the ileocecal valve (Figure A), and stenosis owing to multiple elevated lesions in the terminal ileum (Figure B).","Other lesions were not found except in the gastrointestinal tract, and the patient was diagnosed with localized gastrointestinal ALλ amyloidosis.","Based on the information provided, the patient is a 58-year-old man who presented with a positive fecal occult blood test. Although he does not have any symptoms and physical examination and laboratory tests were unremarkable, colonoscopy revealed polypoid lesions on the ileocecal valve and stenosis due to multiple elevated lesions in the terminal ileum.

The findings of polypoid lesions and stenosis in the ileocecal region and terminal ileum suggest a possible diagnosis of Crohn's disease, which is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that can cause such lesions and strictures. However, other conditions such as intestinal tuberculosis, lymphoma, or adenocarcinoma could also present with similar findings.

Given the context of a positive fecal occult blood test and the colonoscopic findings, the most likely diagnosis is Crohn's disease, especially if there are no other systemic symptoms or risk factors suggestive of malignancy or infection.

10.1053%j.gastro.2014.01.002,"patient_presentation: A 70-year-old white woman was admitted to the hospital with increasing dysphagia and odynophagia that slowly progressed in the course of 7 years.
additional_history: Dysphagia began after osteoporosis treatment with alendronate sodium for 1 year. The patient had a history of caustic substance ingestion at the age of 10 without any posterior related symptoms after a prolonged hospitalization owing to severe caustic damage. She had no history of alcohol or tobacco consumption.
physical_exam: The patient had no weight loss, an unremarkable physical examination, and a normal complete blood count and chemistry panel.
imaging_test_with_photo: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a concentric thickening, lumen-constricting, white rough mucosa in the middle esophagus from 22 to 29 cm (Figure A).",Esophageal hyperkeratosis,"Based on the provided information, the patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of dysphagia and odynophagia that began after osteoporosis treatment with alendronate sodium. The symptoms have been progressively worsening over 7 years. The esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed concentric thickening and lumen-constricting white rough mucosa in the middle esophagus.

Alendronate sodium is a bisphosphonate, which is known to cause esophageal irritation and, in some cases, esophagitis or esophageal strictures due to its potential to cause mucosal damage if not taken properly (e.g., without adequate water or if the patient lies down soon after taking it).

The appearance of the esophagus on endoscopy, with concentric thickening and white rough mucosa, suggests the possibility of esophageal strictures or esophagitis related to bisphosphonate use. Given the history of caustic ingestion in childhood, there might also be a predisposition to esophageal strictures.

Considering these factors, the most likely diagnosis is bisphosphonate-induced esophagitis and resultant esophageal stricture.

10.1016%j.cgh.2017.07.002,"patient_presentation: A 63-year-old woman presented with intermittent abdominal pain and vomiting over one month. The pain was located in the periumbilical area, and the vomiting was associated with postprandial occurrence.
additional_history: The symptoms resolved spontaneously, and her medical history was insignificant.
physical_exam: Physical examination indicated a soft abdomen, and no masses were palpable.
initial_laboratory_results: An occult blood test of the stool was positive. Complete blood count, rheumatologic testing, tumor biomarkers and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were all within the normal range.
imaging_test_with_photo: A radiograph of abdomen performed at symptom onset showed dilatation of the small bowel loops (Figure A).
next_imaging: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed no abnormities of the esophagus or stomach, but nodules and diffuse erosions with mucosal fragility could be seen from the duodenal bulb to the horizontal part (Figure B, left). Colonoscopy with intubation of the terminal ileum to 15 cm identified normal colonic mucosa, but pale mucosa with a granular appearance was present in the terminal ileum (Figure B, right).
third_imaging: Computed tomographic enterography (CTE) demonstrated diffuse wall thickening of the small bowel (Figure C).","Biopsies of the lesions in the bulb-descending junction and horizontal part of the duodenum and in the terminal ileum showed eosinophilic depositions in the lamina propria (Figure D, left, from the horizontal part of the duodenum). Congo red staining further confirmed amyloidosis (Figure D, right)","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 63-year-old woman with intermittent abdominal pain and vomiting, positive occult blood in the stool, and imaging findings suggestive of small bowel involvement. The key findings include:

1. **Symptoms**: Intermittent abdominal pain and vomiting, particularly postprandial, with spontaneous resolution.
2. **Physical Exam**: Soft abdomen with no palpable masses.
3. **Laboratory Results**: Positive occult blood in stool; other tests normal.
4. **Imaging and Endoscopy Findings**:
   - Abdominal radiograph showed dilatation of small bowel loops.
   - EGD showed nodules and diffuse erosions with mucosal fragility in the duodenum.
   - Colonoscopy showed pale, granular mucosa in the terminal ileum.
   - CTE demonstrated diffuse wall thickening of the small bowel.

The combination of these findings suggests a condition affecting the small bowel with mucosal changes and wall thickening, leading to intermittent obstruction symptoms and occult GI bleeding. The presence of nodules, erosions, and mucosal fragility in the duodenum, along with the granular appearance in the terminal ileum, is suggestive of a systemic inflammatory or infiltrative process.

The most likely diagnosis, considering the age, symptoms, and imaging findings, is **small bowel Crohn's disease**. Crohn's disease can cause segmental inflammation, leading to the observed changes in the small intestine, and can present with symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, and occult blood in the stool.

10.1016%j.cgh.2018.03.032,"patient_presentation: A 66-year-old male was transferred to our institution for right flank pain, refractory hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury.
additional_history: The patient received two doses of sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) at the outside facility. He continued to have right flank pain and a CT scan of the abdomen was performed which showed a 3 cm mass in the cecum.
imaging_test_with_photo: Colonoscopy was performed which showed a large mass adjacent to the ileocecal valve (Figure 1)....Due to concerns for malignancy, a repeat colonoscopy was done after 8 days which showed improvement in the size and appearance of the mass lesion (Figure 1).",Repeat biopsies also showed presence of Kayexalate crystals.,"Based on the information provided, the patient is a 66-year-old male with right flank pain, refractory hyperkalemia, and acute kidney injury. A CT scan revealed a 3 cm mass in the cecum, and a colonoscopy showed a large mass adjacent to the ileocecal valve. However, a repeat colonoscopy after 8 days showed improvement in the size and appearance of the mass lesion.

The key points to consider here are the presence of a mass in the cecum and its change in size and appearance over a short period. The improvement in the mass's appearance suggests that it may not be a typical malignant tumor, which would not usually shrink significantly in such a short time frame without treatment. 

One possible explanation for these findings is that the mass could be an inflammatory lesion, such as a phlegmon or an inflammatory polyp, which can decrease in size with the resolution of inflammation. Another possibility could be a submucosal hematoma or edema related to the use of sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate), which can cause gastrointestinal injury and necrosis, leading to mass-like lesions that might resolve over time.

Given the context of refractory hyperkalemia and prior treatment with Kayexalate, it is plausible to consider that the mass could have been related to Kayexalate-induced injury, which is known to cause colonic mucosal damage and can present as a mass-like lesion.

next_imaging: Type V does not have double major duodenal papillae (Figure B).","Given endoscopic findings, types I and V are very unlikely and types II, III, or IV pancreatus divisum should be considered in this case.","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 36-year-old man presenting with intractable nausea and vomiting. During esophagogastroduodenoscopy, double major duodenal papillae were observed. This finding is unusual and suggests an anatomical variation or anomaly in the duodenum.

The presence of double major duodenal papillae is associated with a rare congenital condition known as ""pancreas divisum."" Pancreas divisum occurs when the dorsal and ventral pancreatic ducts fail to fuse during embryonic development, leading to separate drainage of pancreatic secretions through two papillae. This can sometimes lead to abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and pancreatitis due to impaired drainage of pancreatic enzymes.

Given the symptoms of intractable nausea and vomiting, along with the endoscopic finding of double major duodenal papillae, the most likely diagnosis is pancreas divisum.

This is characterized by the presence of pneumobilia (air in the biliary tree), a fistula between the gallbladder and the duodenum, and an impacted gallstone in the intestinal tract, specifically in the third portion of the duodenum. The symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, and bilious vomiting, along with the imaging findings of a large gallstone causing obstruction, support this diagnosis.

imaging_test_with_photo: Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed a cystic mass with a thin cystic wall (Figure A). The cystic tumor had no communication with bowel or any retroperitoneal organ, such as pancreas or adrenal gland.
next_imaging: Laparoscopy revealed an intra-mesenteric cystic tumor (Figure B), which was resected laparoscopically.",Mesenteric cyst in mesenterium of proximal jejunum,"Based on the information provided, the patient is a 34-year-old woman who presented with abdominal fullness, loss of appetite, and the sensation of an intra-abdominal rolling mass. The CT scan revealed a cystic mass with a thin wall that did not communicate with the bowel or any retroperitoneal organs. Laparoscopy confirmed the presence of an intra-mesenteric cystic tumor, which was resected.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is a mesenteric cyst. Mesenteric cysts are rare, benign cystic lesions that occur in the mesentery of the intestine. They can present with abdominal fullness, a palpable mass, and sometimes nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms. The fact that the cyst did not communicate with the bowel or retroperitoneal organs and was located within the mesentery supports this diagnosis.

next_imaging: On diagnostic laparoscopy, a walled-off abscess was seen in the RLQ, and a computed tomography-guided percutaneous drain was placed (Figure B).
third_imaging: Microbiologic evaluation of fluid from the abscess showed acid-fast bacilli on smear (Figure C), and antitubercular treatment was started for suspected abdominal tuberculosis.",16S Ribosomal RNA gene sequence analysis eventually led to the identification of a novel pathogen known as Lawsonella clevelandensis.,"Based on the information provided, the patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of medically refractory ulcerative colitis who underwent a total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. He presented with abdominal pain, swelling, and fever, and imaging revealed a large intra-abdominal mass suspicious for an abscess. Cultures initially showed no organism growth, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex DNA was not detected by PCR. However, microbiologic evaluation of fluid from the abscess later showed acid-fast bacilli on smear.

The presence of acid-fast bacilli in the abscess fluid is highly suggestive of a mycobacterial infection. Given the patient's Caribbean origin and the clinical presentation, abdominal tuberculosis is a strong consideration, despite the initial negative PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex DNA. Acid-fast bacilli can also indicate non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections, but the clinical context and initiation of antitubercular treatment suggest tuberculosis is more likely.

Therefore, the final diagnosis, considering the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and microbiological results, is:

imaging_test_with_photo: Upper endoscopy revealed a 1.5-cm, pedunculated polyp in the proximal esophagus just below the cricopharyngeus (Figure A).
next_imaging: Computed tomography revealed an intraluminal mass at the cervical esophagus without local extension. The polyp was then removed completely using standard polypectomy techniques (Figures B and C).",Lynch-associated esophageal adenocarcinoma arising within gastric heterotopia.,"Based on the information provided, the patient is a 35-year-old man with Lynch syndrome, presenting with progressive solid food dysphagia. Lynch syndrome is associated with an increased risk of various cancers, including colorectal cancer and, to a lesser extent, other gastrointestinal cancers.

The upper endoscopy revealed a 1.5-cm, pedunculated polyp in the proximal esophagus. The endoscopic ultrasonography showed that the lesion was confined to the mucosal layer without periesophageal lymphadenopathy, and the CT scan confirmed an intraluminal mass without local extension. The polyp was removed completely using standard polypectomy techniques.

Given the patient's Lynch syndrome and the location of the polyp in the proximal esophagus, the most likely diagnosis is an esophageal adenoma or a dysplastic lesion, which could potentially progress to esophageal adenocarcinoma if not removed. The absence of lymphadenopathy and confinement to the mucosal layer suggest a low risk of malignancy at this stage.

The dysphagia is localized to the suprasternal notch. The barium swallow study showed a smooth extrinsic indentation on the posterior aspect of the esophagus at the level of T4-T5, and the CTA revealed a vessel compressing the esophagus posteriorly, causing proximal dilatation.

The findings are consistent with an esophageal compression due to a vascular anomaly. The most likely diagnosis, given the location and nature of the compression, is an aberrant right subclavian artery (also known as arteria lusoria), which is a common vascular anomaly that can compress the esophagus and cause dysphagia, known as dysphagia lusoria.
