additional_history: After clinical improvement, he was discharged on a corticosteroid taper and antibiotics with plans for additional small bowel evaluation.
initial_laboratory_results: Upper and lower endoscopy with ileal intubation were normal.
imaging_test_with_photo: Magnetic resonance enterography showed long-segment ileal inflammation and duodenal to transverse colon fistula with small, nondrainable abscesses (Figure A) consistent with CD.
next_imaging: Repeat magnetic resonance enterography showed a blind ending bowel loop in the right upper quadrant (Figure B) and almost complete resolution of imaging abnormalities. 
third_imaging: This suspicion was confirmed by right hemiabdomen focal uptake on Meckel scan (Figure C), and laparotomy demonstrating diverticulum with ectopic gastric mucosa.","This improvement favored an alternate self-limited process, such as perforated Meckel diverticulitis.","Based on the information provided, the patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings initially suggested Crohn's disease due to the presence of ileal inflammation and a fistula. However, further imaging and surgical findings revealed a blind-ending bowel loop and focal uptake on a Meckel scan, which are not typical for Crohn's disease.

The confirmation of a diverticulum with ectopic gastric mucosa during laparotomy is indicative of a Meckel's diverticulum. Meckel's diverticulum can lead to complications such as inflammation, bleeding, and fistula formation, which can mimic Crohn's disease.

Therefore, the final diagnosis, taking into account the Meckel scan and surgical findings, is:

next_imaging: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy demostrated gastritis with severe duodenal bulb inflammation (FIGURE C).",...strongyloides stercoralis present with crypts.,"Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old Bangladeshi man with a history of ulcerative colitis, who has been immunosuppressed due to treatment. He presents with profound weight loss, generalized abdominal pain, and persistent vomiting over several weeks. Imaging studies show marked duodenitis with obstruction causing a distended fluid-filled duodenum, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy reveals gastritis with severe duodenal bulb inflammation.

Given the patient's background of immunosuppression and the findings of severe duodenal inflammation and obstruction, one possible diagnosis to consider is an infectious cause, such as a mycobacterial infection (e.g., tuberculosis) or a fungal infection, which can occur in immunocompromised individuals. However, the specific presentation of duodenal obstruction and inflammation might also suggest a non-infectious cause such as a peptic ulcer disease or Crohn's disease affecting the duodenum, although Crohn's is less likely given the patient's history of ulcerative colitis.

Another possibility to consider is a malignancy, such as a lymphoma, which can cause duodenal obstruction and is more common in immunosuppressed patients.

However, the most likely diagnosis, given the context of immunosuppression and the specific gastrointestinal findings, would be an opportunistic infection such as a fungal infection (e.g., Candida or Histoplasmosis) or mycobacterial infection (e.g., Mycobacterium avium complex or tuberculosis).

additional_history: Her only significant history was that she emigrated from the Republic of Burundi in East Africa 8 years prior.
imaging_test_with_photo: On colonoscopy, there was a distinct mucosal pattern with prominent distorted vasculature and scattered white punctate lesions, which was more pronounced in the right colon (Figures A and B).",...characteristic of Schistosoma mansoni.,"Based on the information provided, the key details include the patient's asymptomatic status, her emigration from the Republic of Burundi in East Africa, and the colonoscopy findings of a distinct mucosal pattern with prominent distorted vasculature and scattered white punctate lesions, particularly in the right colon.

The colonoscopy findings are suggestive of a condition that affects the mucosa and vasculature of the colon. Given the patient's history of living in East Africa, one possible condition to consider is Schistosomiasis, which can cause colonic involvement with similar mucosal changes.

Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by trematode worms of the genus Schistosoma. In endemic areas, such as parts of Africa, Schistosomiasis can lead to chronic infection and result in characteristic changes in the colon, including mucosal and vascular alterations.

Therefore, considering the geographical context and the colonoscopy findings, the most likely diagnosis is Schistosomiasis.

initial_laboratory_results: Her laboratory studies on routine blood, serum C-reactive protein and tuberculosis specific IgG/IgM antibodies almost showed normal, but routine stool examination found some red cells and the result of fecal occult blood test was positive. 
imaging_test_with_photo: A computed tomography scan showed a thickened and edematous large intestine as well as lots of calcifications on the colon wall and in the branches of the colonic blood vessels (Figure A‚ÄìC).
next_imaging: Colonoscopy showed dark purple mucosa with many ulcers and erosions in the colon and rectum (Figure D).
third_imaging: Under the barium enema examination, it showed a stiff large intestine in a sausage shape, and a loss of normal haustra of the colon (Figure E).",Phlebosclerotic colitis,"Based on the provided information, the patient's symptoms and test results suggest a condition affecting the large intestine. The chronic intermittent abdominal pain and difficult defecation, along with the positive fecal occult blood test and presence of red cells in the stool, indicate a possible inflammatory or ischemic process. The CT scan findings of a thickened and edematous large intestine with calcifications on the colon wall and in the colonic blood vessels are particularly suggestive.

The colonoscopy findings of dark purple mucosa with many ulcers and erosions, combined with the barium enema showing a stiff, sausage-shaped large intestine and loss of normal haustra, are classic for ischemic changes in the colon.

The presence of calcifications in the colon wall and blood vessels, along with the ischemic changes, strongly suggest chronic ischemic colitis. This condition can lead to calcification of the blood vessels (phlebosclerosis) and subsequent ischemic damage to the colon.

imaging_test_with_photo: ...an initial esophagogastroduodenoscopy finding of an IIc lesion in the gastric body (Figure A).
next_imaging: Magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging identified a well-defined lesion with distorted, dilated, and partially sparse central microglandular structures. In addition, the microvessels obviously were distorted, dilated, and partially disappeared (Figure B). Endoscopic ultrasound showed that the superficial layer of the mucosa was thinned, whereas the deep layer was thickened. The deep layer was approximately 1.4-mm thick at its deepest part. The submucosa and muscularis propria were intact. ",Amyloidosis was diagnosed....Primary gastric focal amyloidosis was diagnosed.,"Based on the provided information, the patient is a 54-year-old man with an early gastric cancer diagnosis following an esophagogastroduodenoscopy. The lesion is described as a type IIc lesion, which typically indicates a superficial depressed lesion. Magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging shows a well-defined lesion with distorted, dilated, and partially sparse central microglandular structures, as well as distorted and dilated microvessels. Endoscopic ultrasound findings indicate thinning of the superficial mucosal layer and thickening of the deep mucosal layer, with the submucosa and muscularis propria remaining intact.

These findings are consistent with an early gastric cancer, specifically an intramucosal carcinoma, where the cancerous cells are confined to the mucosa and have not invaded the submucosa or deeper layers. The intact submucosa and muscularis propria suggest that the cancer has not progressed beyond the mucosal layer, which is characteristic of early-stage gastric cancer.

additional_history: Since the surgery in 2009 there had not been any complications involving his graft. His past medical history was also significant for gastrointestinal (GI) history of celiac disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and esophageal strictures requiring dilation on 2 occasions. He is followed by a gastroenterologist in the outpatient clinics for these issues and has been stable for many years. His initial presentation to the emergency room was with a clinical picture suggestive of septic shock endorsing symptoms of fevers, chills, rigors, and new-onset nausea. 
physical_exam: On physical examination, vital signs showed a temperature of 39.9¬∞C, heart rate of 110 beats/min, respiratory rate 22 breaths/min, and blood pressure of 70/48 despite receiving 4 L of normal saline. Other than signs of poor peripheral circulation and epigastric pain on palpation the physical examination was otherwise noncontributory. He was subsequently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. 
initial_laboratory_results: His biochemistry showed a white blood cell count of 3.9 x 10^9 (reference range, 3.5‚Äì12 x 10^9), C-reactive protein of 35.4 mg/L (reference range, 0.0‚Äì8.0), and a lactate level of 3 mmol/L (reference range, 0.5‚Äì2.2). The remainder of his bloodwork, which included electrolytes, liver function tests, coagulation status, and creatinine, were all normal.
imaging_test_with_photo: However, closer review and inspection of the ulcer highlighted a circumferential abnormality within the ulcer edges that seemed to have a regular stripped pattern (Figure A).",Secondary aortic enteric fistula,"Based on the information provided, the patient is a 65-year-old man with a history of peripheral vascular disease and aortofemoral bypass graft placement, who now presents with symptoms suggestive of septic shock, including fever, chills, rigors, and new-onset nausea. The physical examination shows poor peripheral circulation and epigastric pain, and laboratory results indicate elevated C-reactive protein and lactate levels, suggesting an inflammatory or infectious process. The white blood cell count is within the lower end of the normal range.

The imaging test description mentions a circumferential abnormality with a regular stripped pattern within the ulcer edges, although the context does not provide details about the location or nature of the ulcer.

Given the history of vascular disease and the presence of septic shock, one important consideration is an infection related to the vascular graft, such as a graft infection or mycotic aneurysm. The presentation of septic shock, poor peripheral circulation, and elevated inflammatory markers supports this possibility. The description of the ulcer with a circumferential abnormality may suggest a vascular or graft-related issue.

imaging_without_photo: He underwent computed tomography colonography (CTC) to evaluate the colon segments not assessed by conventional colonoscopy. 
imaging_test_with_photo: The CTC demonstrated a 3-cm pedunculated polyp in the ascending colon on the supine acquisition (Figure A, axial soft tissue window; arrow; Figure B, coronal lung window) and on 3-dimensional endoluminal view (Figure C, arrow). The polyp was homogeneous and showed soft tissue attenuation, with no fat attenuation (Figure A).",Recurrent dedifferentiated liposarcoma presenting as a pedunculated colonic polyp,"Based on the information provided, the patient is a 71-year-old man who is asymptomatic and underwent a computed tomography colonography (CTC) after an incomplete colonoscopy. The CTC revealed a 3-cm pedunculated polyp in the ascending colon. The polyp is homogeneous and shows soft tissue attenuation, with no fat attenuation.

The patient's history includes a surgically resected retroperitoneal well-differentiated liposarcoma 10 years ago, with a recurrence as dedifferentiated liposarcoma 6 years later. However, the current finding in the colon appears to be unrelated to his previous liposarcoma, given the homogeneous soft tissue nature of the polyp and the lack of fat attenuation.

The characteristics of the polyp (pedunculated, homogeneous, soft tissue attenuation) suggest that it is most likely a benign adenomatous polyp, which is a common type of polyp found in the colon. These polyps can potentially be precancerous, so they are typically removed and examined histologically to rule out any dysplasia or malignancy.

The MRI findings indicate a defect in the anterior rectal wall, a collection anterior to the rectum, a communication between the prostate and rectum, and a small prostate abscess.

The combination of these findings suggests the presence of a rectoprostatic fistula, which is an abnormal connection between the rectum and the prostate. This condition can occur as a complication of radiation therapy, leading to the symptoms of rectal pain and hematochezia due to the communication between the rectum and prostate.

The upper endoscopy findings of a poorly distensible stomach with severely nodular, erythematous, and friable mucosa involving the gastric body, fundus, and antrum suggest a significant gastric involvement.

Given the patient's HIV status, severe immunosuppression, and the characteristic endoscopic and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is gastrointestinal Kaposi sarcoma.

The initial laboratory results were within normal limits, which includes tumor markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9), as well as prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Cystoscopy findings were suspicious for a colovesical fistula or bladder diverticulum. However, a CT scan revealed an incidental finding in the pancreas.

The combination of weight loss and dysuria, along with the incidental pancreatic finding on CT, raises suspicion for a pancreatic pathology. Although the tumor markers were normal, pancreatic lesions can sometimes present with normal tumor markers, especially in early stages or in certain types of pancreatic tumors.

Given the incidental finding in the pancreas and the patient's symptoms, the possibility of a pancreatic neoplasm should be considered. The CT finding in the pancreas could represent a pancreatic tumor, such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma or a pancreatic cystic lesion. However, without specific details on the nature of the pancreatic finding (e.g., solid mass, cystic lesion, size, etc.), it is challenging to specify the exact type of pancreatic pathology.

Considering the information provided and the incidental pancreatic finding, the most likely diagnosis is a pancreatic neoplasm, potentially pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which can present with systemic symptoms like weight loss.

The diarrhea resolves upon fasting, suggesting a possible secretory or osmotic cause. The imaging reveals marked tortuosity of the splenic vein and a filiform stenosis of the portal vein anastomosis.

The combination of chronic diarrhea, previous surgeries, and imaging findings suggests a possible diagnosis of:

- Portal hypertension secondary to portal vein stenosis, which may lead to increased intestinal permeability and diarrhea.
- The tortuosity of the splenic vein could be a compensatory mechanism due to portal vein stenosis.
- The diarrhea resolving upon fasting suggests that it may be related to increased intestinal transit or secretion, potentially exacerbated by portal hypertension.

Sigmoidoscopy findings include multiple small yellowish plaques and diverse polypoid lesions with erythema, edema, and friability in the sigmoid colon, which bleed easily on contact. The CT scan confirms multiple polyps confined to the sigmoid colon.

The combination of these findings, particularly the appearance of the lesions on sigmoidoscopy and the patient's use of corticosteroids, suggests a diagnosis of ischemic colitis or possibly steroid-induced colonic changes. However, the presence of multiple small yellowish plaques and polypoid lesions is more characteristic of a specific condition known as ""pseudomembranous colitis,"" typically associated with Clostridium difficile infection.

The serum CEA level is within normal range, which is not particularly indicative of colorectal cancer but does not rule it out either.

The sigmoidoscopy findings of an irregular bulging submucosal tumor with friable, erythematous overlying rectal epithelium are suggestive of a malignant process. The whole-body CT and pelvic MRI findings of a locally advanced rectal tumor with diffuse lymphadenopathy around the mesorectum, aorta, mediastinum, and neck are highly indicative of a metastatic disease.

3. **Microcephaly**: The child has microcephaly.

4. **Unremarkable Genetic Testing**: The CGH array and testing for Mowat-Wilson disease were unremarkable.

The combination of dysmorphic features, gastrointestinal issues, and microcephaly suggests a syndromic condition. The presence of diverticula in the distal rectum and anorectal junction is particularly unusual and suggests a possible connective tissue disorder or a condition affecting the structure of the bowel.

Given these findings, a potential diagnosis could be a rare genetic syndrome associated with connective tissue abnormalities and gastrointestinal issues, such as a variant of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or another similar connective tissue disorder. However, the specific combination of features and the presence of rectal diverticula are not typical for many common conditions.

Considering the gastrointestinal symptoms and the presence of diverticula, a condition such as Megacystis Microcolon Intestinal Hypoperistalsis Syndrome (MMIHS) could be considered, although it typically presents with more severe symptoms and different imaging findings.

The negative stool cultures and serologies for infectious and autoimmune diseases, along with the family history of diarrhea, are also important considerations.

The combination of gastrointestinal symptoms, skin lesions, and systemic signs such as fever and weight loss, along with the colonoscopic findings, are suggestive of an inflammatory bowel disease. The presence of deep ulcers and pseudopolyps in the colon are characteristic of Crohn's disease, which can also present with extraintestinal manifestations such as skin lesions (e.g., pyoderma gangrenosum or erythema nodosum) and oral ulcers.

1. **Patient Demographics and Presentation**: 
   - The patient is a 65-year-old woman.
   - She presents with altered bowel habits and mild epigastric pain.
   - She is otherwise healthy with an unremarkable medical history except for a complicated hysterectomy.

2. **Procedures and Tests**:
   - The patient underwent a gastroscopy and colonoscopy due to her symptoms.
   - A CT scan of the abdomen was performed.

3. **Symptoms**:
   - Altered bowel habits can suggest a range of gastrointestinal issues, including irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, or even malignancy.
   - Mild epigastric pain could be related to gastric or duodenal issues, pancreatitis, or other abdominal conditions.

4. **Additional Considerations**:
   - The patient's age and gender could increase the risk for certain conditions, such as colorectal cancer or diverticular disease.
   - The history of a complicated hysterectomy might be relevant if there were adhesions or other complications affecting the bowel.

Without specific findings from the gastroscopy, colonoscopy, or CT scan, it is challenging to pinpoint the exact diagnosis. However, given the symptoms and the typical concerns in a patient of this age, one might consider conditions such as diverticular disease, colorectal cancer, or even an abdominal mass affecting bowel habits.

Since the context does not provide specific findings from the imaging or endoscopic procedures, I would need more detailed results to make a more precise diagnosis. However, based on the typical presentation, a common consideration could be diverticular disease or a neoplastic process.

4. A colonoscopy revealed a fistulous opening in the rectum.
5. A CT cystogram showed contrast in the rectum and sigmoid colon, indicating an abnormal connection between the urinary and gastrointestinal tracts.

Considering the history of radiation therapy and the findings on imaging, the most likely diagnosis is a rectovesical fistula. This is a pathological connection between the rectum and the bladder, which can occur as a complication of radiation therapy.

The presence of a large intragastric mass with these characteristics, particularly in an elderly patient, suggests the possibility of a gastric tumor. The description of a pedunculated polypoid tumor with necrotic substance and hyperplastic changes could be indicative of a gastric adenoma or a more malignant process such as a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) or gastric adenocarcinoma. However, the necrotic substance and hyperplastic changes lean towards a malignant process.

She has a history of spinal disc herniation, for which she has been taking tilidine, ibuprofen, and prednisolone. Additionally, she has chronic Leriche syndrome.

Key findings from the physical examination include confusion, signs of meningism (positive Kernig‚Äôs sign), and abdominal tenderness. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein, increased neutrophil ratio, mild hyperglycemia, and hypoxemia (low SpO2).

The presence of fever, confusion, and signs of meningism suggests a central nervous system infection, such as meningitis or encephalitis. The use of prednisolone, an immunosuppressant, could predispose the patient to infections. The abdominal tenderness and elevated inflammatory markers raise the possibility of an intra-abdominal source of infection or inflammation, but the neurological signs are more prominent.

The CT scan findings, although not detailed in the text, are likely to support the diagnosis of a central nervous system infection, given the clinical presentation.

Considering the combination of fever, altered mental status, signs of meningism, and the patient's immunosuppressed state due to steroid use, bacterial meningitis is a strong possibility.

The current presentation involves an esophageal polypoid lesion, with endoscopy showing a pedunculated polyp and heterotopic gastric mucosa (HGM) in the upper esophagus. Heterotopic gastric mucosa in the esophagus is a condition where gastric-type mucosa is found in the esophagus, often referred to as an ""inlet patch.""

Given the patient's history of multiple cancers and the family history suggestive of Lynch syndrome, there is a possibility that the esophageal lesion could be related to this syndrome, although Lynch syndrome is not typically associated with esophageal cancer. The presence of heterotopic gastric mucosa is a separate finding and is generally benign, though it can sometimes be associated with complications or neoplastic changes.

Considering the patient's extensive cancer history and the current esophageal lesion, it is important to evaluate the polypoid lesion for neoplastic changes. However, without histopathological examination results, it is not possible to definitively diagnose the nature of the esophageal polyp.

next_imaging: Laparotomy was pursued for surgical management of the strictures. Intraoperatively, the small bowel was massively dilated up to 15 cm, notably uncharacteristic for Crohn's-associated strictures (Figure B), and full thickness small bowel biopsies were obtained.","Based on these clinical and histologic features, a diagnosis of degenerative leiomyopathy complicated by intestinal pseudo-obstruction was established.","Based on the information provided, the patient's symptoms of progressive constipation, bloating, and significant weight loss, along with the imaging findings of distal small bowel dilation, short segment strictures, bowel wall thickening, and mucosal hyper-enhancement, initially suggested Crohn's disease. However, the lack of improvement with adalimumab, a TNF inhibitor commonly used in Crohn's disease, and the intraoperative findings of massive small bowel dilation up to 15 cm, which is atypical for Crohn's-associated strictures, suggest an alternative diagnosis.

The massive dilation and the presence of strictures are more characteristic of a condition that causes obstruction due to neuromuscular dysfunction rather than inflammatory strictures typical of Crohn's disease. This presentation is more consistent with a diagnosis of small bowel pseudo-obstruction, which can be caused by a variety of underlying conditions, including chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO).

additional_history: He had been diagnosed 1 year earlier with a left-sided colon cancer revealed by altered bowel habits. At diagnosis, the preoperative evaluation did not show distant metastasis. The patient underwent left hemicolectomy, which showed a 4-cm, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma invading the omentum (T4a). Thirty regional lymph nodes were positive for tumor extension (N2b). There was no microsatellite instability, and no KRAS mutations were found. The tumor was classified as stage IIIc disease based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer classification. The patient then received an oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy (modified FOLFOX6) for 6 months. Three months after the end of chemotherapy, 2 pulmonary metastases were diagnosed, 1 in each lung. A positron emission tomography-computed tomography also showed suspicious mediastinal adenopathy. An irinotecan-based treatment (FOLFIRI) with the addition of bevacizumab was then started. Three months later, the size of the lesions diminished and the patient underwent 2 successful lung surgeries to remove the metastases and the adnopathy. In the following months, the patient noticed a painless swelling of his left tonsil. He did not report symptoms of pharyngitis or tonsillitis.
physical_exam: Physical examination revealed an ulcerated mass on the upper part of his left tonsil (Figure A, black arrow). There were no palpable cervical lymph nodes. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.

He has undergone multiple treatments, including surgery and chemotherapy. The current presentation involves a painless ulcerated mass on the left tonsil, which is unusual for primary tonsillar conditions such as infections or benign lesions, especially given the patient's cancer history.

The development of a new mass in the tonsil, particularly in the context of a patient with a history of metastatic colorectal cancer, raises the suspicion of metastatic disease to the tonsil. While colorectal cancer most commonly metastasizes to the liver and lungs, metastasis to the tonsil, although rare, can occur, especially in the setting of widespread metastatic disease.

The absence of cervical lymphadenopathy and normal carcinoembryonic antigen levels do not rule out metastatic disease, as metastatic lesions can sometimes present without significant elevation in tumor markers or lymph node involvement.

Given the patient's history and the current clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis for the tonsillar mass is metastatic colorectal cancer to the tonsil.

There is significant weight loss of 4.0 kg over 2 months. Endoscopy and imaging studies reveal a mass in the esophagus with a longitudinal ulcer, hypoechoic on EUS, originating from the muscularis propria, and a space-occupying lesion seen on barium meal radiography.

The characteristics of the mass, including its location, hypoechoic nature, origin from the muscularis propria, and the presence of a smooth surface and hard texture, are suggestive of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) or possibly a leiomyoma. However, the weight loss and ulceration raise suspicion for a malignant process.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is an esophageal leiomyoma, which is a benign tumor arising from the smooth muscle layer of the esophagus. However, due to the weight loss and ulceration, further investigation, including biopsy and histopathological examination, would be necessary to rule out malignancy such as a leiomyosarcoma or other esophageal cancer.

The presence of air in the gastric wall (pneumatosis) and portal venous system, along with the findings from the endoscopy, suggest ischemia and necrosis of the gastric tissue. The stenosis of the celiac axis and the retrograde filling from the superior mesenteric artery indicate compromised blood flow to the stomach, leading to ischemia.

The patient's history includes risk factors such as a history of syphilis, exposure to Chlamydia, and a pet dog. The transient rash that resolved at presentation may also provide a clue.

Given these details, the colonoscopy findings are highly suggestive of an infectious or inflammatory process. In patients with HIV, even with an undetectable viral load, certain infections are more common. The presence of aphthous ulcers and the patient's sexual history point towards a possible sexually transmitted infection affecting the gastrointestinal tract.

The laboratory results show significantly elevated serum ammonia levels, and the imaging reveals an abnormal venous connection where the superior mesenteric vein and splenic vein drain directly into the left renal vein, leading to a massively dilated inferior vena cava.

The elevated serum ammonia level suggests a condition that leads to hyperammonemia. In the context of abnormal venous drainage, this is indicative of a portosystemic shunt or a condition that results in impaired hepatic clearance of ammonia. The abnormal venous anatomy described in the imaging is consistent with an intra-abdominal portosystemic shunt, which can cause ammonia-rich blood from the intestines to bypass the liver, leading to systemic hyperammonemia and resultant episodic confusion (hepatic encephalopathy).

Considering the patient's Marfan's Syndrome, which is associated with connective tissue abnormalities, the development of abnormal vascular connections or aneurysms could be more likely, although Marfan's itself is not directly associated with portosystemic shunts.

The combination of gallbladder stones and polyps, along with the patient's symptoms, suggests a condition related to gallbladder pathology. The presence of polyps in the gallbladder can be associated with cholesterolosis or adenomyomatosis, but given the history of Clonorchis sinensis, there is a higher likelihood of a condition related to prior parasitic infection.

2. **Additional History**: There is no history of weight loss, vomiting, or bleeding per rectum. The patient has been investigated for infertility, which might be a relevant detail.

3. **Physical Exam**: The abdomen is mildly tender and distended, but there's no visceromegaly or other significant findings.

4. **Laboratory Results**: Complete blood count, blood biochemistry, and thyroid profile are normal, which rules out common metabolic or systemic causes.

5. **Imaging Test**: The CT scan of the abdomen shows unusual findings. Although I cannot view the images, the mention of ""unusual findings"" suggests an abnormality that might not be typical for common conditions.

Given the recurrent nature of the symptoms and the investigation for infertility, one potential consideration is a gastrointestinal condition that can cause obstruction-like symptoms. The lack of systemic symptoms (weight loss, vomiting, bleeding) and normal lab results suggest a localized issue rather than a systemic disease.

Considering the patient's age, recurrent symptoms, and the investigation for infertility, one possibility is a condition like a congenital defect or an anatomical abnormality that could cause intermittent obstruction. A condition like a volvulus, internal hernia, or a congenital band could cause such symptoms and might not always be evident on initial exams.

Another possibility, considering the infertility investigation, is a rare condition like cystic fibrosis, which can cause gastrointestinal issues and infertility in men due to congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD). However, this is less likely given the age and lack of systemic symptoms.

Laboratory tests show hyponatremia with low plasma osmolality and normal urinary osmolality and sodium concentration, alongside a metabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap.

The combination of these findings suggests a condition known as Madelung's disease, also known as multiple symmetric lipomatosis (MSL). This rare disorder is characterized by the accumulation of unencapsulated fat deposits, primarily in the upper body, neck, and shoulders. The presence of hyponatremia and metabolic acidosis could be related to underlying metabolic disturbances or associated conditions often seen in patients with MSL, such as alcohol use disorder, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances and liver dysfunction.

He presented with melena, which indicates gastrointestinal bleeding. The imaging studies revealed portal collaterals forming varices around the common bile duct, with extravasation of contrast into the common bile duct and duodenum, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed bleeding from the papilla of Vater. Additionally, projectile hemobilia occurred after the removal of a biliary stent.

Hemobilia refers to bleeding into the biliary tree, which can occur due to various causes, including trauma, tumors, or vascular abnormalities. In this case, the presence of portal collaterals and varices around the common bile duct suggests that the bleeding is related to portal hypertension and the formation of varices in the biliary system, known as portal biliopathy. The extravasation of contrast and bleeding from the papilla of Vater further support this diagnosis.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is hemobilia secondary to portal hypertensive biliopathy, associated with portal vein thrombosis and variceal formation around the biliary tree.

Endoscopic ultrasonography showed a heterogeneous lesion in the third layer of the gastric wall with cystic components.

The combination of these findings, particularly the mucinous secretion, the polyp's location and appearance, and the endoscopic ultrasound findings, is highly suggestive of a gastric submucosal tumor. The description of the polyp and the mucinous secretion are characteristic of a gastric hyperplastic polyp or potentially a gastric adenoma. However, the presence of cystic components and mucinous secretion is more indicative of a gastric adenoma with possible malignant transformation or a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) with atypical features.

Given the age of the patient, the severe anemia, and the characteristics of the lesion, the most likely diagnosis is a gastric adenoma with high suspicion for malignant transformation, possibly into an adenocarcinoma.

The description of a string-like structure in the colon, along with the absence of a tumor, suggests the possibility of a parasitic infection, specifically a tapeworm or another type of helminth. The string-like structure could be a part of the parasite. Given the lack of tumor characteristics and the unusual appearance, a parasitic infection is a plausible explanation.

Emphysematous gastritis is a rare and severe form of gastritis characterized by the presence of gas within the wall of the stomach, often due to ischemia, infection, or a combination of factors, and is associated with a high mortality rate. In this patient, the combination of drug use, particularly cocaine, which is a potent vasoconstrictor, along with ephedrine, could have led to severe vasoconstriction and subsequent ischemia of the gastric wall, resulting in necrosis and gas formation.

The CT findings of a thickened gallbladder wall with pericholecystic stranding, combined with the history and imaging findings, suggest a recurrence or persistence of gallbladder inflammation.

The presence of gallstones (calculi) and the described imaging findings are consistent with chronic cholecystitis, possibly with ongoing inflammation or complications such as an empyema or a contained perforation. The fact that the patient has stage III adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is also relevant, as it could contribute to biliary obstruction or other complications, but the normal bilirubin level suggests that there is no significant obstruction at this time.

The CT scan showed bowel wall thickening and intussusceptions in the jejunum and proximal ileum.

The combination of symptoms, particularly the diarrhea and leg swelling (edema), along with the hypoalbuminemia, suggests a protein-losing enteropathy. The video capsule endoscopy findings of blunted and whitish villi are indicative of lymphatic obstruction or damage, which can cause protein loss. The bowel wall thickening and intussusceptions seen on the CT scan further support the presence of lymphatic abnormalities.

However, during the venous phase, the lesion's density was similar to the surrounding liver parenchyma, which is characteristic of certain benign lesions such as focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) or hepatocellular adenoma.

The diagnostic laparoscopy revealed multiple unexpected nodules of different sizes throughout the left upper abdominal quadrant, located within the greater omentum, mesentery, and peritoneal surfaces, including the diaphragm. This finding is not typical for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which usually presents with a single lesion or multiple lesions confined to the liver, especially in the setting of cirrhosis.

The presence of multiple nodules scattered throughout the peritoneum and omentum raises the suspicion of peritoneal metastases, which is more consistent with a primary malignancy that has metastasized to the peritoneum.

There is severe compression and possible infiltration of the portal vein, as well as compression and extrahepatic dilatation of the distal bile duct. Enlarged peripancreatic and hepatic hilar lymph nodes are also present.

The presentation of a pancreatic mass with both solid and cystic components, especially in a young woman, raises suspicion for a mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN) or an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). However, the presence of solid components, irregular enhancement, and lymphadenopathy suggest a more aggressive pathology.

Given the patient's age, gender, and the imaging characteristics of the mass, a solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) of the pancreas is a strong consideration.

The lesions include two arterially enhancing lesions and numerous isointense hypoenhancing lesions in the right lobe.

The key points to consider are:
- The patient has elevated alkaline phosphatase and GGT, which suggest a possible cholestatic or infiltrative liver process.
- The mildly elevated ACE level can be associated with sarcoidosis or other granulomatous diseases.
- The MRI findings of arterially enhancing lesions and hypoenhancing lesions are significant. Arterially enhancing lesions in the liver can be seen in hepatocellular carcinoma, adenomas, or vascular lesions such as hemangiomas. However, the presence of multiple lesions and the elevated ACE level point towards a systemic process.
- The negative viral hepatitis serologies, autoimmune serologies, and tumor markers rule out common causes of liver lesions like viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, and primary liver cancer.

Given the combination of elevated ACE, multiple liver lesions, and the exclusion of other common causes, the findings are suggestive of hepatic involvement in sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis can cause granulomatous infiltration in the liver, leading to the observed imaging and laboratory findings.

One of the malignancies that can occur in patients with AIDS is non-Hodgkin lymphoma, particularly primary pancreatic lymphoma or other forms of extranodal lymphoma. Another possibility is Kaposi's sarcoma, although it is less common in the pancreas.

Given the imaging findings and the patient's immunocompromised status, the most likely diagnosis is a type of lymphoma, such as a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which is known to occur in the setting of AIDS and can present with masses in the pancreas and lymphadenopathy.

The human immunodeficiency virus infection was controlled by antiretroviral therapy (elvitegravir, emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide, cobicistat), with an undetectable viral load and a normal CD4 T-cell count....A rectal swab and biopsy samples were collected for virologic, bacteriologic, and histologic examinations. Because of the strong suspicion of sexually transmitted disease, a probabilistic treatment by doxycycline (100 mg, twice a day, for 7 days) and ceftriaxone (a 500-mg intranmuscular single dose) was prescribed. Histology examination showed nonspecific ulcerative colitis, without granuloma. Polymerase chain reaction, performed on the rectal swab, showed a Chlamydia trachomatis infection (genotype L).

The patient's history of unprotected anal intercourse, combined with the polymerase chain reaction test results indicating a Chlamydia trachomatis infection (genotype L), strongly suggests a diagnosis of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV). LGV is a sexually transmitted infection caused by certain serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis, including genotype L, and is known to cause proctocolitis, especially in men who have sex with men.

The patient's symptoms improved after treatment with doxycycline and ceftriaxone, and the rectosigmoidoscopy showed complete healing of the ulcers, which is consistent with the resolution of LGV following appropriate antibiotic therapy.

He presents with symptoms of cirrhosis including abdominal distension and confusion, and has been on warfarin therapy. The physical examination shows signs of ascites and edema, and laboratory tests indicate elevated liver enzymes and a prolonged INR due to warfarin. The imaging test reveals a large peripancreatic lesion with mass effect.

The key findings here are the presence of a large peripancreatic lesion with enhancement on the portal venous phase and the patient's background of liver disease and portal vein thrombosis. The lesion's enhancement pattern and location suggest a possible malignancy, such as a pancreatic adenocarcinoma or a cholangiocarcinoma, which could cause portal vein thrombosis and liver dysfunction.

The CT scan revealed bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy and multiple enlarged cardiophrenic lymph nodes. An upper endoscopy was normal, but the colonoscopy showed multiple soft, semi-sessile polypoid lesions throughout the colon.

The combination of gastrointestinal symptoms, lymphadenopathy, and the presence of multiple polypoid lesions in the colon suggests a possible diagnosis. The presence of axillary lymphadenopathy and cardiophrenic lymph nodes may indicate a systemic condition. The polypoid lesions in the colon could be indicative of a lymphoproliferative disorder affecting the gastrointestinal tract.

Given these findings, one possible diagnosis is a gastrointestinal manifestation of a systemic lymphoma, such as a mantle cell lymphoma, which can present with lymphadenopathy and gastrointestinal involvement with polypoid lesions (lymphomatous polyposis).

She presented with odynophagia and dysphagia 4 weeks after the transplant. Initial endoscopy revealed a 20cm hiatal hernia and severe LA D esophagitis. Despite treatment with proton pump inhibitors, her esophagitis showed minimal improvement over the following 3 months. However, on follow-up endoscopy, there was complete healing and resolution of the esophagitis and symptoms.

The key points to consider are:
- The patient is immunosuppressed due to her transplant medications.
- The esophagitis was severe and persistent despite PPI therapy, which suggests a non-acid-related cause.
- Complete healing occurred eventually, which could indicate a self-limiting or treatable condition.

Given the patient's immunosuppressive state, one possible cause of esophagitis that can present with similar symptoms and endoscopic findings is viral esophagitis, particularly due to cytomegalovirus (CMV) or herpes simplex virus (HSV). These infections are more common in immunocompromised individuals and can cause severe esophagitis that may not respond to acid suppression therapy but can resolve with appropriate antiviral treatment or spontaneously as the immune system adjusts post-transplant.

Laboratory findings show anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated bilirubin, low albumin, elevated lipase, and prolonged prothrombin time. The CT scan showed a hyperdense lesion over the duodenum with fat stranding.

The elevated serum lipase suggests pancreatitis, which can cause abdominal pain and is consistent with the CT findings of fat stranding around the duodenum. The presence of a duodenal ulcer and the history of tarry stools suggest that the ulcer may have been bleeding, which could account for the anemia. The hyperdense lesion on CT could represent a complication of the ulcer, such as a penetrating ulcer or a pseudoaneurysm, but given the elevated lipase and the clinical presentation, acute pancreatitis is a likely consideration.

The NICE (Narrow-band imaging International Colorectal Endoscopic) classification is a system used to categorize colorectal polyps based on their surface and vascular patterns observed under NBI. 

- NICE type 1 is typically associated with hyperplastic polyps, which are benign and have a low risk of malignancy. These polyps usually have a lighter color, regular surface pattern, and regular vascular pattern.
- NICE type 2 is associated with adenomas, which have the potential for malignancy. These polyps usually have a brownish color, irregular surface pattern, and irregular vascular pattern.

In this case, the narrow-band imaging initially suggested a brownish area on the head of the polyp, which might indicate NICE type 2. However, the overall surface and vessel pattern were indicative of NICE type 1.

The presence of esophageal varices and numerous sessile polyps in the stomach and duodenum, along with diffuse hemorrhage, suggests a condition associated with portal hypertension and possibly a hyperplastic or inflammatory response in the gastric mucosa.

The patient's recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding and refractory ascites persisted despite a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), which reduced the portosystemic gradient. The significant improvement in symptoms following liver transplantation, including the resolution of ascites and gastrointestinal bleeding, and the involution of gastric and duodenal polyps, further supports a diagnosis related to the liver disease and portal hypertension.

The sessile polyps in the stomach and duodenum, which resolved after the liver transplant, suggest that these were likely hyperplastic or inflammatory polyps secondary to portal hypertension, known as portal hypertensive gastropathy or duodenopathy.

The laboratory results indicate an elevated bilirubin level and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.7, which are consistent with liver dysfunction. The ascitic fluid analysis shows a low white cell count (WCC) of 35 cells/mm¬≥, which suggests that spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is unlikely, as SBP typically presents with a WCC greater than 250 cells/mm¬≥. The serum albumin-ascites gradient (SAAG) of 9 g/dL is quite high, indicating that the ascites is likely due to portal hypertension, which is consistent with cirrhosis.

The cross-sectional imaging and PET scan findings are particularly noteworthy. The PET scan shows intense uptake of a thickened peritoneum, indicating a metabolically active process. This finding, along with the negative culture and cytology of the ascitic fluid, suggests a non-infectious, non-malignant cause of peritoneal inflammation.

Given the context of cirrhosis, ascites, and the imaging findings, one possible diagnosis is peritoneal tuberculosis. Tuberculous peritonitis can present with ascites and thickening of the peritoneum, and it may not always be detected on routine culture and cytology.

The obstruction resolved without surgical intervention, but she continued to experience recurrent postprandial abdominal pain. 

The imaging studies included a negative upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, colonoscopy, and biopsies for Crohn's disease. Capsule endoscopy revealed two small intestinal ulcers attributed to NSAID use. CT enterography showed a 15 cm long dilated segment near the Meckel's diverticulum.

The presence of a dilated segment near the Meckel's diverticulum, combined with the patient's symptoms, suggests the possibility of complications related to a Meckel's diverticulum. Meckel's diverticulum can lead to complications such as bleeding, obstruction, and inflammation. The patient's bloody stools and history of obstruction could be explained by a Meckel's diverticulum, which can cause intermittent obstruction and bleeding due to ectopic gastric mucosa.

He subsequently underwent salvage autologous SCT with high-dose melphalan conditioning. The patient‚Äôs posttransplant course was notable for grade 4 mucositis with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Infectious workup for his persistent symptoms, including testing for Clostridium difficile, fecal leukocytes, Cyclospora, Giardia, Isospora, Cryptosporidium, Microsporidia, stool cultures, and ova and parasites was negative. CT of the abdomen with oral contrast was unremarkable. Supplemental enteric feeding via Dobhoff tube was initiated and symptom control was achieved with scheduled loperamide. He was discharged after adequate engraftment off immunosuppression 30 days after SCT on valacyclovir, pentamidine, micafungin, and posaconazole for prophylaxis.

He has severe mucositis and was on multiple prophylactic medications, including valacyclovir, pentamidine, micafungin, and posaconazole. The esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed large, cratered esophageal ulcers with adherent exudates in the upper and middle third of the esophagus.

The combination of severe mucositis, immunosuppression, and the appearance of esophageal ulcers suggests an infectious etiology, particularly given the patient's prophylactic regimen. The presence of cratered esophageal ulcers with adherent exudates is highly suggestive of viral esophagitis, particularly due to reactivation of herpes simplex virus (HSV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV), which are common in immunocompromised patients, especially following stem cell transplantation.

Given the prophylactic regimen that includes valacyclovir, which is effective against HSV, CMV esophagitis is more likely. CMV can cause large, deep ulcers in the esophagus, which aligns with the endoscopic findings.

The diagnosis of CD was made based on the findings of colonoscopy and endoscopic biopsy. Weeks after the onset of gastrointestinal (GI) tract symptoms, rashes developed on the face, upper chest, and limbs. After systemic corticosteroids, his diarrhea and cutaneous manifestation resolved gradually. One month before this admission, the patient experienced a gradual onset of diarrhea despite medical therapy.

The skin lesions are described as multiple well-demarcated, erythematous, crusted serpiginous patches in a photodistributed manner on the neck, axillae, hands, and feet. 

The patient also has a history of gastrointestinal symptoms consistent with Crohn‚Äôs disease, which were previously managed with systemic corticosteroids. However, he recently experienced a recurrence of diarrhea despite ongoing medical therapy. 

The normal laboratory results, including serum zinc levels, and the absence of infection in stool studies are notable. The colonoscopy showed a normal appearance of the colonic mucosa and terminal ileum, which suggests that the Crohn‚Äôs disease may be in remission or not currently active in the colon.

The skin findings, particularly their photodistribution and the description of the lesions, are suggestive of a condition related to nutritional deficiencies, possibly exacerbated by the underlying Crohn‚Äôs disease. 

Given these considerations, the skin manifestations, and the history of Crohn‚Äôs disease, this presentation is highly suggestive of necrolytic migratory erythema, which is associated with glucagonoma syndrome. However, the normal laboratory results and lack of other systemic symptoms make this less likely.

Another possibility is nutritional deficiency dermatitis, such as pellagra, which is caused by niacin (vitamin B3) deficiency. Pellagra is characterized by the ""3 Ds"": dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia (not always present). The dermatitis is typically photosensitive and can present with erythematous, crusted, and serpiginous patches in sun-exposed areas, which matches the description of the patient‚Äôs skin lesions.

Considering the history of Crohn‚Äôs disease, which can lead to malabsorption and nutritional deficiencies, and the specific characteristics of the skin lesions, the most likely diagnosis is pellagra due to niacin deficiency.

1. **Rectal bleeding and abdominal pain**: These are common symptoms that can be associated with a variety of gastrointestinal conditions.

2. **Low hemoglobin level (9.8 g/dL)**: This suggests anemia, likely due to gastrointestinal bleeding.

3. **Physical examination findings**: Tenderness in the right lower quadrant, voluntary guarding, and a positive Rovsing sign suggest possible appendicitis or another form of localized peritonitis.

4. **Imaging findings**:
   - **Cecal diverticulitis with concern for microperforation**: This indicates inflammation and possible small perforations in the diverticula of the cecum.
   - **Altered venous drainage of the portal system, venous nodularity and calcification, and phleboliths within the wall of the rectosigmoid colon consistent with hemangiomas**: These findings suggest the presence of vascular abnormalities, possibly related to a condition affecting the venous system.
   - **Colonic varices identified on colonoscopy**: The presence of varices in the colon is unusual and suggests portal hypertension or another vascular disorder.

5. **Hemangiomas on the right lateral hip**: This could be a cutaneous manifestation of a systemic vascular condition.

The combination of colonic varices, altered venous drainage, and hemangiomas suggests a vascular disorder, potentially related to a condition like **Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus Syndrome (BRBNS)**.

",Esophagitis due to fungal Candida species,"Based on the provided information, the 86-year-old male patient presents with a combination of symptoms and clinical findings that need to be carefully considered. 

Key points from the case include:

1. **Symptoms and History**: The patient has a one-month history of reduced general condition, weakness, relapsing fever, and epigastric pain with tenderness. He has a background of rheumatic disease (with long-term steroid use), mild reflux esophagitis, hiatus hernia, colonic pandiverticulosis, valvular and hypertensive cardiopathy, and chronic renal insufficiency.

2. **Laboratory Findings**: The laboratory results showed elevated inflammatory markers, elevated transaminases, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Blood and urine cultures were sterile.

3. **Imaging and Endoscopy**: Endoscopic evaluation revealed white mucosal plaque-like lesions in the esophagus.

Considering these points, the presence of white mucosal plaque-like lesions in the esophagus, particularly in a patient with a history of long-term steroid use, suggests the possibility of esophageal candidiasis. This condition is common in immunocompromised patients, such as those on long-term steroids, and can present with fever, malaise, and gastrointestinal symptoms.

The improvement in fever, inflammatory markers, thrombocytopenia, and anemia following antibiotic treatment may indicate a secondary bacterial infection or an inflammatory response that was controlled with antibiotics, but the primary esophageal condition is likely fungal.

- Gastroscopy shows erythematous gastric body mucosa with thickened rugal folds.

The combination of cholangiopathy with beading of the biliary tree, splenic varices, and multiple small bowel polyps is suggestive of a condition known as ""Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis"" (PSC). PSC is often associated with inflammatory bowel disease, but in this case, the colonoscopy excluded inflammatory bowel disease. The presence of small bowel polyps and gastric changes may suggest an overlap with another condition, such as ""Familial Adenomatous Polyposis"" or ""Peutz-Jeghers syndrome,"" but the primary liver-related findings are most consistent with PSC.

The pain is intermittent, occurring every 2‚Äì3 months, and does not accompany fever or hematochezia. Initial investigations, including gastroscopy, colonoscopy, and abdominal CTA, were unremarkable, except for a suspicion of right ileocolic artery stenosis, which led to treatment for ischemic bowel disease without symptom improvement.

Further imaging with magnetic resonance enterography showed thickening of small bowel walls in the left upper abdomen. Double-balloon endoscopy revealed patchy redness and congestion at two sites in the small intestine.

The combination of intermittent abdominal pain, constipation, bowel wall thickening, and endoscopic findings of patchy redness and congestion suggests a chronic inflammatory process affecting the small intestine. The absence of fever and hematochezia, along with normal initial imaging and laboratory results, makes inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's disease a likely consideration.

The combination of esophageal polyps and a family history of gastric cancer suggests the possibility of a hereditary syndrome. One such condition that could present with esophageal polyps is ""Familial Adenomatous Polyposis"" (FAP), which can lead to the development of multiple polyps in the gastrointestinal tract, including the esophagus. FAP is associated with mutations in the APC gene and can increase the risk of various cancers, including gastric cancer, which aligns with the family history.

The electroencephalogram indicates generalized seizures, and the abdominopelvic CT shows scattered radiopaque densities.

The combination of hypocalcemia, generalized seizures, and the presence of radiopaque densities in the abdomen on CT suggests the possibility of hypoparathyroidism or a condition leading to calcium deposition. However, the history of opium addiction and the presence of radiopaque densities on abdominal imaging are highly suggestive of opium-induced hypocalcemia due to the formation of bezoars or concretions in the gastrointestinal tract, which can lead to malabsorption and subsequent hypocalcemia.

1. **Jaundice and Bilirubin Levels**: The patient has jaundice with elevated total and direct bilirubin levels, indicating a conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which suggests a post-hepatic (obstructive) cause.

2. **Imaging Findings**: 
   - Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and ERCP show dilated intrahepatic bile ducts and cystic dilation of the extrahepatic bile duct.
   - A long common channel (20 mm) was noted, which is longer than usual and can be associated with pancreaticobiliary maljunction.
   - The presence of a dominant dorsal duct and complete pancreas divisum was noted on ERCP.

3. **Pancreaticobiliary Maljunction**: The long common channel suggests a pancreaticobiliary maljunction, which can lead to bile duct dilation and potential reflux of pancreatic enzymes into the bile duct, causing inflammation and dilation.

4. **Pancreas Divisum**: This is a congenital anomaly where the dorsal and ventral pancreatic ducts do not fuse, resulting in the majority of pancreatic drainage occurring through the minor papilla. This can sometimes be associated with pancreatitis, but in this case, the focus seems to be on the biliary tree.

5. **Elevated Amylase in Bile**: The high amylase level in the bile indicates reflux of pancreatic enzymes into the bile duct, which is consistent with pancreaticobiliary maljunction.

Considering these findings, the patient's symptoms and imaging are consistent with a condition known as **Choledochal Cyst**.

The endoscopic ultrasonography indicated that the lesion originated from the second and third layers of the gastric wall. The differential diagnosis initially included gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), malignant lymphoma, and myoma.

The key details to consider are:
- The submucosal location of the tumor in the stomach.
- The tumor's elastic and hard consistency.
- The origin from the second and third layers, which suggests involvement of the muscularis mucosa and submucosa.
- The normal findings on ultrasonography and CT for heart, liver, and kidneys, which do not indicate metastasis or systemic involvement.

imaging_test_with_photo: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a dilated common bile duct with peri-ampullary biliary stenosis (Figure A).
next_imaging: A dilated bile duct wtih an abrupt terminus just above the duodenal wall and no drainage of contrast to duodenum was seen on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (Figure B, arrow).
third_imaging: Therefore, a biliary sphincterotomy was performed, and thickened biliary mucosa resembling a polyp was seen (Figure C).",Biliary amyloidoma as a cause for pancreatitis,"Based on the provided information, the patient is an 84-year-old woman who presented with epigastric pain and was diagnosed with biliary pancreatitis. The laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin, suggesting a possible obstruction in the biliary system. Imaging studies revealed a dilated common bile duct with peri-ampullary biliary stenosis and an abrupt terminus of the bile duct above the duodenal wall with no drainage of contrast, suggesting an obstruction at the ampulla of Vater.

During the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), a biliary sphincterotomy was performed, and thickened biliary mucosa resembling a polyp was observed. This finding is suggestive of an ampullary or peri-ampullary lesion, which could be causing the obstruction.

The presence of a polypoid lesion at the ampulla of Vater, along with the imaging findings and clinical presentation, is highly suggestive of an ampullary adenoma or possibly an ampullary carcinoma. These lesions can cause biliary obstruction and lead to the symptoms and laboratory findings observed in this patient.

imaging_test_with_photo: The pancreas was enlarged with fluid, and the main pancreatic duct was slightly dilated (Figure A, B).
next_imaging: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a large tumor originating in the antrum that had prolapsed through the pylorus into the duodenum (Figure C, endoscopic view in gastric antrum; Figure D, endoscopic view in duodenum).","Acute pancreatitis, biliary obstruction, and gastroduodenal intussusception induced by an early gastric cancer","Based on the information provided, the patient is a 77-year-old man who presented with severe epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. The laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), elevated bilirubin, and a significantly elevated amylase level. The CT scan shows a mass in the second portion of the duodenum, and the pancreas is enlarged with fluid and a slightly dilated main pancreatic duct. The esophagogastroduodenoscopy reveals a large tumor originating in the antrum of the stomach that has prolapsed through the pylorus into the duodenum.

The combination of these findings suggests a gastric outlet obstruction due to a prolapsing gastric tumor, which is likely causing acute pancreatitis. The elevated amylase level and pancreatic changes on imaging are indicative of pancreatitis. The mass seen on imaging and endoscopy is likely a gastric tumor (such as a gastric adenocarcinoma) that has prolapsed into the duodenum, causing obstruction and secondary pancreatitis.

physical_exam: On palpation a vague, soft, horizontally placed, cystic, 10 x 5 cm lump was palpable in the epigastric area.
imaging_test_with_photo: On abdominal roentgenogram multiple calcifications were seen along the pancreatic duct (Figure A), and ultrasonography showed a hugely dilated (4 cm) pancreatic duct (Figure B).
next_imaging: The main pancreatic duct was hugely dilated (4.3 cm) with a suspicious mass in the head of the pancreas (Figures C and D).The dilated pancreatic duct reached up to the anterior abdominal wall (Figure C) and therefore the palpable lump correlated wtih the location of the hugely dilated main pancreatic duct on imaging.","On computed tomography of the abdomen the pancreatic head was irregular, heterogeneous, with coarse calcification, and the tail was atrophic with calcification.","Based on the information provided, the patient has a history of episodic epigastric pain radiating to the back, which has worsened over the past 3 months. Physical examination reveals a palpable cystic lump in the epigastric region. Imaging studies show multiple calcifications along the pancreatic duct, a hugely dilated pancreatic duct (4.3 cm), and a suspicious mass in the head of the pancreas. 

The combination of these findings is highly suggestive of chronic pancreatitis, likely due to pancreatic duct obstruction, possibly from a pancreatic pseudocyst or a neoplasm such as an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) or pancreatic cancer. The presence of calcifications and ductal dilation are classic signs of chronic pancreatitis.

During acute attacks, inflammatory changes were noted within the pelvis adjacent to a large, inflamed, sigmoid diverticulum. These findings were consistent with acute sigmoid diverticulitis. He was treated with antibiotics. 
imaging_test_with_photo: During colonoscopy, there was significant sigmoid luminal narrowing with near circumferential erythematous and bluish mucosa (Figure A and Video Clip) at 35 cm from the anal verge.

The CT scans showed diffuse colonic diverticula, and during acute attacks, inflammatory changes consistent with acute sigmoid diverticulitis were noted. The colonoscopy revealed significant sigmoid luminal narrowing with near circumferential erythematous and bluish mucosa, which was later identified as the base of several elongated and pedunculated polyps.

The combination of diverticulosis, episodes of diverticulitis, and the presence of elongated and pedunculated polyps with erythematous and bluish mucosa suggests a diagnosis of colonic polyposis syndrome. Specifically, the appearance of the polyps and the patient's age and presentation are suggestive of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, which is characterized by hamartomatous polyps and mucocutaneous pigmentation. However, without specific mention of mucocutaneous pigmentation, another possibility is a variant of juvenile polyposis syndrome or another form of polyposis syndrome.

additional_history: On questioning, the patient describes recurrent episodes of similar symptoms. These begin with the sudden onset of nausea. Often the nausea will be constant for days. During a matter of hours her symptoms will progress to include nonbloody emesis. Often she will vomit 4-6 times a day. Occasionally she will experience nonbloody diarrhea associated with these episodes. She can identify no triggering events or exacerbating factors, although she attributes the recent increase in her symptoms to stress from a family conflict. Warm baths seem to improve her symptoms somewhat. Typically her symptoms are preceded by an aura and migraine headache. Often her headache will resolve before the nausea and vomiting. These episodes have been occurring for about the last 1 1/2 years. She has no history of functional gastrointestinal disorders.
imaging_without_photo: During the course of her multiple hospitalizations the patient was subjected to an extensive evaluation in an attempt to identify an etiology for her symptoms. A magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain was normal. An abdominal computed tomography scan demonstrated only nonspecific abnormalities. An evaluation of her gallbladder showed a few small gallstones; a hepato-iminodiacetic acid scan was normal. A gastric emptying study performed during an admission for nausea and vomiting showed normal gastric emptying time. A host of disease serologies including amylase and lipase, C1-esterase studies, celaic sprue serologies, human immunodeficiency virus testing, cardiac enzymes, and testing for paraneoplastic syndromes were negative. ","No undelying etiology can be found to explain the patient's episodic nausea and vomiting. Initially a positive toxicology for urine cannabinoids prompted consideration of cannabis hyperemesis as a potential etiology....Because of her persistent symptoms and the presence of a few small gallstones on ultrasound, the patient was referred to the surgery clinic for laparoscopic cholecystectomy....She was also referred to a psychiatrist, who evaluated her and diagnosed her with generalized anxiety disorder....The patient's presentation is very suggestive of cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) because she has recurrent episodes with symptom-free intervals and a history of migraine headache.","Based on the information provided, the patient is a 53-year-old woman experiencing recurrent episodes of intractable nausea and vomiting, often accompanied by migraine headaches and occasionally nonbloody diarrhea. These episodes are not triggered by any identifiable factors, although stress seems to exacerbate them. Warm baths provide some relief. The episodes are sometimes preceded by an aura, and the headache often resolves before the nausea and vomiting. The extensive evaluation, including imaging and various serologies, has not identified any specific organic cause for her symptoms.

The combination of cyclic episodes of nausea and vomiting, the presence of migraines, and the relief provided by warm baths suggests a condition known as ""Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome"" (CVS). CVS is characterized by recurrent, stereotypical episodes of severe nausea and vomiting with symptom-free intervals. It is often associated with migraine headaches and can be triggered or worsened by stress.

",Vesiculopustular Eruption of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Based on the presented information, the patient has a history of ulcerative proctitis with severe bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and new onset skin and oral lesions. The patient has a primary non-response to mesalamine and intolerance to oral corticosteroids. Laboratory findings include severe anemia, hypoalbuminemia, elevated CRP, and significantly elevated fecal calprotectin, indicating severe inflammation. The CT scan shows proctitis and sigmoid colitis. The colonoscopy reveals severely ulcerated mucosa in the rectum and sigmoid colon. Skin lesions are described as erythematous, vesicular, and pustular with central ulceration and crusting.

These findings are suggestive of a severe inflammatory bowel disease flare with extraintestinal manifestations. The skin and oral lesions, along with the ulcerative colitis, are highly suggestive of pyoderma gangrenosum and possibly erythema multiforme or another related dermatological condition associated with inflammatory bowel disease.

On physical examination, a 4 cm hard non-mobile mass was noted, along with small satellite lesions.

The presentation of a hard, non-mobile mass at the colostomy site, along with satellite lesions, suggests a possible malignant process. Given the location and characteristics of the mass, one potential diagnosis to consider is a colostomy site carcinoma, specifically a squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma, which can occur at colostomy sites. The presence of satellite lesions further supports the possibility of a malignant process, as these can represent local spread or metastasis.

The CT scan shows retrograde intussusception of the small-bowel anastomosis into the stomach and pneumatosis of the intussusceptum. Upper endoscopy reveals a large protuberant mass in the stomach with edematous mucosa.

The combination of these findings suggests that the patient is experiencing a retrograde intussusception at the site of the gastrojejunostomy, which is a rare complication. The presence of pneumatosis indicates possible ischemia or necrosis of the intussuscepted bowel segment. The mass seen on endoscopy is likely the intussuscepted bowel itself.

The nodules have a hypoechoic to isoechoic center with a hyperechoic peripheral halo on ultrasound, and they appear as hypodense donut-shaped lesions on CT with a normodense center. MRI findings show these lesions as hyperintense on T2-weighted sequences but not visible on fat-suppressed T2-weighted or T1-weighted sequences after gadolinium administration. 

The laboratory findings show mild iron overload with H63D homozygosity, which is a variant of the HFE gene associated with hereditary hemochromatosis, but the iron overload is mild.

The imaging characteristics of the liver nodules, particularly the ""donut"" appearance on CT and the T2 hyperintensity without enhancement on T1-weighted sequences, are suggestive of benign liver lesions rather than metastatic disease.

The bedside abdominal sonogram revealed multiple liver tumors with ascites, and paracentesis confirmed bloody ascites. The laboratory tests indicate elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin, and the imaging studies (CT and MRI) show multiple hypodense hepatic tumors with high-density ascites and diffuse variable-sized tumors with low intensity on T1-weighted images and high intensity on T2-weighted images.

The combination of multiple liver tumors, bloody ascites, elevated liver enzymes, and the imaging characteristics suggest a malignant liver condition. The sudden onset of symptoms and the presence of bloody ascites raise the suspicion of a tumor rupture. The patient's age and lack of history of viral hepatitis or alcoholism make primary liver cancer less likely, but not impossible.

Given the imaging findings and clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is a metastatic liver disease, potentially from an undiagnosed primary cancer elsewhere, such as a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) or another form of sarcoma, which could present with such features.

He is originally from Peru and last visited there 4 years ago. His stool tests for ova, parasites, and common bacterial infections are negative. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a normal stomach and duodenum, while a colonoscopy revealed normal colon mucosa but superficial ulcerations in the terminal ileum.

The presence of superficial ulcerations in the terminal ileum is a key finding. This, combined with the chronicity of symptoms and the negative stool tests, suggests a possible inflammatory or infectious etiology affecting the ileum.

Considering the patient's background and the findings:

- The chronic nature and location of the ulcerations in the terminal ileum could suggest Crohn's disease, which often affects the ileum and can cause abdominal pain and bloating.
- Infectious causes such as tuberculosis (intestinal TB) could be considered, especially given the patient's origin from Peru, but the chronicity and lack of systemic symptoms like fever or weight loss make this less likely.
- Celiac disease could cause similar symptoms, but it typically does not cause ulcerations in the terminal ileum.

The endoscopy revealed a 10-mm friable pedunculated polyp in the gastric body.

Given the patient's age, history of cancer, and the characteristics of the gastric polyp (friable and pedunculated), there is a concern for a neoplastic process. In the context of gastric polyps, the differential diagnosis can include hyperplastic polyps, adenomatous polyps, and malignant lesions such as gastric adenocarcinoma or metastatic disease.

Considering the patient's remote history of renal cell carcinoma, there is a possibility of metastatic disease, although this is less common after such a long interval. However, the more likely scenario given the presentation is a primary gastric neoplasm.

The most common type of malignant gastric polyp in this age group would be a gastric adenocarcinoma. However, without histological examination, a definitive diagnosis cannot be made.

10.1016%j.cgh.2018.02.040,"patient_presentation: A 48-year-old woman with no past medical history presented to the primary care clinic with right-sided abdominal pain, fatigue, and a 20-pound weight loss over 3 months.
additional_history: She described a short period of heavy alcohol use (a bottle of wine per day for 3 years), although she had been abstinent for 1 year prior to presentation. She has two daughters with Alagille's syndrome. She had no other risk factors for liver disease.
initial_laboratory_results: Initial evaluation revealed abnormal liver biochemical tests (alanine aminotransferase: 130 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase: 107 U/L, alkaline phosphatase: 622 U/L, total bilirubin: 0.9mg/dL). 
imaging_test_with_photo: An abdominal MRI was performed, which revealed multiple well defined focal lesions throughout the liver (Panel A).
next_imaging: A liver biopsy was persued to secure the diagnosis. Remarkably, the 17-gauge needle used for the biopsy bent upon contact with the liver because of the extensive tumor burden (Panel B).",...moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) consistent wtih the fibrolamellar/oncocytic variant.,"Based on the provided information, the patient is a 48-year-old woman with right-sided abdominal pain, fatigue, and significant weight loss. Her laboratory tests show elevated liver enzymes, particularly alkaline phosphatase, which suggests cholestasis or liver obstruction. The MRI shows multiple well-defined focal lesions throughout the liver, and the liver biopsy was difficult due to the extensive tumor burden, which suggests a very firm or fibrotic liver tissue.

The history of heavy alcohol use, though she has been abstinent for a year, could have contributed to liver damage, but the most striking detail is the mention of her two daughters having Alagille's syndrome. Alagille's syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the liver, heart, and other systems, and it is associated with bile duct paucity leading to cholestasis.

Considering the combination of elevated alkaline phosphatase, the presence of multiple liver lesions, and the difficulty in obtaining a liver biopsy due to the firmness of the liver, this presentation is highly suggestive of a condition known as hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (HEHE). HEHE is a rare vascular tumor of the liver that can present with multiple liver lesions and can cause the liver to become very firm, making biopsy challenging.

additional_history: Endoscopic ultrasonography using mini-probe revealed hypoechoic with hyperechoic mass located mainly in the second to third layer of the jejunal wall.
imaging_test_with_photo: Contrast enhanced computed tomography showed well-demarcated and highly enhanced mass lesion in the small bowel (A).
next_imaging: Ante-grade double-balloon enteroscopy revealed a yellowish submucosal tumor measuring 30 mm in size, located in the jejunum (B).",Ectopic pancreas,"Based on the provided information, the patient has a small bowel lesion that was detected through various imaging techniques. The lesion is described as a hypoechoic and hyperechoic mass located mainly in the second to third layer of the jejunal wall on endoscopic ultrasonography. The contrast-enhanced CT scan shows a well-demarcated and highly enhanced mass lesion in the small bowel. Additionally, ante-grade double-balloon enteroscopy revealed a yellowish submucosal tumor measuring 30 mm in size in the jejunum.

The characteristics of the lesion, including its location, appearance on imaging, and the description from enteroscopy, suggest a submucosal tumor in the small intestine. The most common type of submucosal tumor in the small bowel is a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). GISTs often appear as well-circumscribed, enhancing masses on CT and can present as submucosal lesions with a yellowish appearance during endoscopy.

additional_history: She was previously healthy and denied any surgery. 
initial_laboratory_results: At presentation, the laboratory findings and tumor markers were within the normal range.
imaging_test_with_photo: The abdominal ultrasound demonstrated an 8.0 x 6.6-cm, heterogeneous mass in the pancreatic tail (Figure A, arrow), and 2 liver masses measuring ",Serious cystadenocarcinoma of the pancreas with liver metastasis,"Based on the information provided, the findings are suggestive of a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET), particularly given the characteristics of the pancreatic mass and liver lesions. 

The following points support this diagnosis:
1. The pancreatic mass is described as a large, solid, cystic mass with central tiny foci of calcification. This is a common feature of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.
2. The liver lesions show peripheral hyperenhancement with a hypovascular center, which is consistent with metastatic lesions from a neuroendocrine tumor.
3. The progressive enhancement pattern of the pancreatic mass and the presence of gastric varices due to splenic vein occlusion are also indicative of a PNET.
4. The normal laboratory findings and tumor markers may be consistent with non-functioning PNETs, which do not secrete hormones that would alter standard laboratory tests.

physical_exam: On examination, there was tenderness in the right upper quadrant of abdomen.
initial_laboratory_results: Her laboratory parameters were normal.  
imaging_without_photo: Ultrasonography was reported as showing thickened gallbladder wall with fusiform dilatation of common bile duct and mild dilatation of intrahepatic biliary radicles consistent with a choledochal cyst.
imaging_test_with_photo: Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatiography and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, however, showed fusiform dilatation of main portal vein (measuring 26 x 14 mm) at the level of splenoportal confluence (Figure A and B, arrows). Gallbladder was normal. However, there was no evidence of chronic liver parenchymal disease.
next_imaging: Doppler study confirmed the diagnosis of portal vein aneurysm (Figure C and D, arrows).",Doppler study confirmed the diagnosis of portal vein aneurysm.,"Based on the detailed information provided, the patient presented with right upper quadrant pain, nonbilious vomiting, and tenderness in the right upper quadrant. Initial ultrasonography suggested a choledochal cyst, but subsequent imaging with MRCP and MRI revealed a fusiform dilatation of the main portal vein at the splenoportal confluence, not a choledochal cyst. The Doppler study confirmed the presence of a portal vein aneurysm.

The key findings are:
- Fusiform dilatation of the main portal vein.
- Confirmation of portal vein aneurysm via Doppler study.
- No evidence of chronic liver parenchymal disease.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of a portal vein aneurysm, which is a rare vascular anomaly characterized by the dilatation of the portal vein. The initial ultrasound findings suggesting a choledochal cyst were not corroborated by the more definitive imaging studies.

10.1053%j.gastro.2008.03.050,"patient_presentation: A 65-year-old woman with a recent history of jaundice (1 month) complained of right epigastric pain and pruritus. 
additional_history: Her medical history was remarkable for breast adenocarcinoma treated with surgery and irradiation 20 years earlier.
initial_laboratory_results: Preliminary laboratory analyses revealed abnormal liver functions consistent with obstructive jaundice.
imaging_without_photo: Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography scan showed dilatation of common and intrahepatic bile ducts without lithiasis. Upper digestive endoscopy was normal. Subsequent endoscopic ultrasound revealed normal pancreas and papilla of Vater, and demonstrated stenosis of the common bile duct with major dilatation in the biliary tree. There was no typical feature of choledochal cyst.
imaging_test_with_photo: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) disclosed a stricture (Figure A, arrows) of the hilar biliary duct with marked proximal biliary dilatation. A double biliary endoprothesis was inserted, and sphincterectomy was performed. The cytologic biliary brushing showed no abnormal cells.
next_imaging: CT performed in our institution after portal embolization (small hepatic left lobe) was retrospectively reviewed (Figure B) and small, cystic, nonopacifying lesion (arrow) adjacent to the main biliary duct was observed (long arrow; biliary endoprothesis).",Extrahepatic biliary cystadenoma with mesenchymal stroma,"Based on the provided information, the patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of breast adenocarcinoma treated 20 years ago, who now presents with obstructive jaundice, right epigastric pain, and pruritus. Imaging studies reveal a stricture at the hilar biliary duct with marked proximal biliary dilatation, but no evidence of lithiasis or pancreatic abnormality. The ERCP showed a stricture, but cytologic biliary brushing was negative for abnormal cells. A small cystic lesion adjacent to the main biliary duct was noted on CT after portal embolization.

The key findings are the hilar stricture, biliary dilatation, absence of choledochal cyst features, and the presence of a small cystic lesion adjacent to the main biliary duct. The negative cytology suggests a non-malignant cause, although malignancy cannot be completely ruled out based on cytology alone.

The combination of these findings, particularly the hilar stricture and cystic lesion, suggests the possibility of a biliary cystic lesion such as a choledochal cyst or a biliary cystadenoma. However, given the patient's age and the nature of the stricture, a malignant process such as cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer) should be strongly considered, especially in the context of a hilar stricture (Klatskin tumor).

The laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, hyponatremia, elevated creatinine, and elevated lactic acid levels, suggesting possible dehydration and metabolic stress.

The CT imaging findings are crucial in this case. They reveal pneumobilia, which indicates air in the biliary tree, and an extensive cholecystocolonic fistula, which is an abnormal connection between the gallbladder and the colon. Additionally, there is a gallstone obstructing the sigmoid colon.

These findings are characteristic of a condition called gallstone ileus. In gallstone ileus, a gallstone passes through a fistula (in this case, a cholecystocolonic fistula) and enters the intestinal tract, where it can cause obstruction. The presence of pneumobilia and the obstructing gallstone in the sigmoid colon further support this diagnosis.

next_imaging: A colonoscopy revealed a large intraluminal polypoid hard mass starting about 5 cm above anal verge and extending upward about 12 cm (Figure B). The rectal lumen was almost obstructed by the mass. Endoscopic ultrasound demonstrated a rectal mass invading the perirectal fat pad and involving 1 perirectal lymph node. A biopsy was taken of the mass.","The best histopathologic interpretation was an anaplastic malignant tumor, possibly undifferentiated/anaplastic leiomyoscaroma.","Based on the provided information, the 19-year-old patient presents with a large solid mass in the rectum, iron deficiency anemia, and symptoms of lower abdominal pain, weight loss, difficulty in passing stool, and blood in the stool. The colonoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound findings indicate a large intraluminal polypoid hard mass in the rectum, with invasion into the perirectal fat and involvement of a perirectal lymph node. These findings are highly suggestive of a malignant process.

The patient's age, symptoms, and the characteristics of the mass raise a strong suspicion for colorectal cancer, specifically rectal cancer. The presence of iron deficiency anemia and weight loss further supports this diagnosis, as these are common systemic manifestations of colorectal malignancies.

The biopsy of the mass will provide definitive histological confirmation, but based on the current clinical and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is rectal adenocarcinoma.

The MR imaging and MR cholangiopancreatography show numerous subcentimeter, well-circumscribed, T1-weighted hypointense and T2-weighted hyperintense nonenhancing lesions throughout the hepatic parenchyma with normal-caliber bile ducts, consistent with Von Meyenburg complexes or multiple biliary hamartomas.

The combination of symptoms, imaging findings, and the presence of a common bile duct stone suggests that the patient is experiencing complications related to choledocholithiasis (common bile duct stone), which can lead to cholangitis (infection of the bile duct) and sepsis.

The esophagogastroduodenoscopy confirmed a large stone in the duodenal bulb, which was successfully fragmented and extracted.

This clinical presentation is characteristic of a condition known as gallstone ileus, which occurs when a gallstone passes into the intestinal tract and causes an obstruction.

The tumor was approximately 4 cm in size and was resected via polypectomy.

The presence of a tumor in the distal ileum with an ulcerative surface and a thick stalk, along with gastrointestinal bleeding (melena), suggests a small bowel tumor. The lack of mucocutaneous pigmentation and the patient's age make Peutz-Jeghers syndrome unlikely, and the characteristics of the tumor are more consistent with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) or possibly a carcinoid tumor.

Given the location in the distal ileum and the presentation, the most likely diagnosis is a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), which are known to occur in the small intestine and can present with bleeding due to ulceration.
