10.1053%j.gastro.2016.08.048,"patient_presentation: A 14-year-old girl of African descent, presented with severe abdominal pain at the pediatric department. 
additional_history: The pain had started 3 days earlier and initially was intermittent, diffuse, and cramping. At presentation it had become continuous, progressively increasing in intensity, and accompanied by vomiting up to 3 times a day. She reported the tendency to move around constantly in search of a comfortable position. There was no fever, diarrhea, or dysuria and she regularly passed stool. Her medical history was unremarkable and she claimed not to be sexually active. 
physical_exam: On clinical examination, a sick-looking girl was noted with normal vital signs. Auscultation of heart and lungs revealed no abnormalities. A non-distended abdomen with reduced abdominal peristalsis was noted in addition to diffuse tenderness at the slightest touch, hampering deep palpation. No muscle guarding was noted, however. The intra-abdominal organs could not be palpated and there was no vaginal discharge.
initial_laboratory_results: Her laboratory results showed hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 67.3 fL, leukocytes of 10.2 x 10^3/ŒºL, platelets of 394 x 10^3 Œº/mL, serum iron of 20 Œºg/dL, C-reactive protein of 32.2 mg/dL, serum creatinine of 0.76 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen of 20 mg/dL. In addition, normal coagulation times, glucose, electrolytes, and liver enzymes were noted. Her urinalysis showed microscopic leukocyturia and hematuria with mild proteinuria (0.39 g/L), raising suspicion of a urinary tract infection. Pregnancy testing was negative.
imaging_without_photo: An ultrasound of the abdomen was done and showed some free abdominal fluid, but the appendix could not be identified. Other abdominal organs including the kidneys and gallbladder did not show stones or other abnormalities. To exclude a surgical origin a computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen with oral contrast was performed.
imaging_test_with_photo: Computed tomography imaging (Figure A) revealed the presence of free abdominal fluid, but once again no appendix could be identified. There were also signs of small bowel obstruction with a positive small bowel feces sign.",Acute appendicitis with perforation and secondary small bowel obstruction,"Based on the provided information, the 14-year-old girl presents with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, anemia, and laboratory findings suggestive of inflammation. The CT scan indicates the presence of free abdominal fluid and signs of small bowel obstruction. The presence of anemia with microcytic indices (low mean corpuscular volume) and the girl's African descent raise the possibility of a hemoglobinopathy such as sickle cell disease or trait, which can lead to vaso-occlusive crises and abdominal pain.

The clinical picture is consistent with a vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease, which can cause severe abdominal pain due to mesenteric ischemia or splenic sequestration, and is often accompanied by anemia and elevated inflammatory markers. The absence of the appendix on imaging and the lack of fever or leukocytosis make acute appendicitis less likely. The small bowel obstruction and free fluid could be secondary to the vaso-occlusive crisis affecting the mesenteric circulation.

Final Diagnosis: Vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease.",INCORRECT,COMMON,216
10.1016%j.cgh.2018.08.006,"patient_presentation: A 74-year-old man received systemic chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer for 11 months.
additional_history: After 4 courses of chemotherapy, the supraclavicular and paraaortic lymph node metastases had become smaller, and surgical resection of the primary tumor was scheduled. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography was performed for preoperative restaging of cancer.
imaging_test_with_photo: Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (Figure A) detected a significant accumulation of glucose analogues in the duodenum, in addition to the primary tumor of gastric cancer and lymph node metastasis.
next_imaging: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy confirmed many whitish, flat, and polypoid lesions in the duodenum (duodenal bulb (Figure B)...
third_imaging: ...and descending part (Figure C)).","Distant metastasis of cancer to the gastrointestinal tract often takes the form of a submucosal tumor, while intramucosal metastasis can take an epithelial tumor-like form.","Based on the information provided, the patient is a 74-year-old man with advanced gastric cancer undergoing systemic chemotherapy. During preoperative restaging, a fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan revealed significant glucose uptake in the duodenum, in addition to the primary gastric tumor and lymph node metastases. Subsequent esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed many whitish, flat, and polypoid lesions in the duodenum.

The findings of FDG uptake in the duodenum and the presence of whitish, flat, and polypoid lesions are suggestive of a secondary pathological process in the duodenum. In the context of a patient with advanced gastric cancer, this could represent metastatic disease, but the description of the lesions as ""whitish, flat, and polypoid"" is more characteristic of a benign or premalignant condition rather than metastatic cancer.

The duodenal lesions described could be indicative of duodenal adenomas or possibly a condition such as duodenal lymphoid hyperplasia. However, given the patient's history of chemotherapy and the appearance of the lesions, one potential diagnosis to consider is duodenal involvement by a secondary process such as lymphoma or a secondary primary tumor like duodenal adenocarcinoma, although the latter is less common.

Considering the context and the appearance of the lesions, a plausible diagnosis is duodenal adenomas, possibly related to a condition like familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) if there is a genetic predisposition, or another form of polyposis syndrome, although this is speculative without further genetic or family history data.

Final Diagnosis: Duodenal adenomas (considering the possibility of a polyposis syndrome).",INCORRECT,COMMON,46
10.1053%j.gastro.2018.10.002,"patient_presentation: A 60-year-old man with a past medical history of long-standing gastroesophageal reflux disease, treated surgically 12 years before, was referred to esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) owing to increasing heartburn.

imaging_test_with_photo: EGD disclosed 2 blue-toned, well-defined, subepithelial lesions in the cardia, approximately 15 mm in diameter (Figure A, B).
next_imaging: We performed endoscopic ultrasound (GF- UCT180, Olympus Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan) that shown 2 well-demarked, rectangle-shaped, homogenous, and hypoechogenic areas, 15 x 8 mm in size (Figure C).",The gatekeeper reflux repair system,"Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease who has undergone surgical treatment. He is now experiencing increased heartburn. The esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed two blue-toned, well-defined, subepithelial lesions in the cardia, each approximately 15 mm in diameter. The endoscopic ultrasound showed these lesions as well-demarked, rectangle-shaped, homogenous, and hypoechogenic areas, measuring 15 x 8 mm.

The key features of these lesions are their subepithelial location, blue tone, well-defined margins, and hypoechogenic nature on ultrasound. These characteristics are suggestive of lesions such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), leiomyomas, or other submucosal tumors. However, the blue tone of the lesions is particularly suggestive of a condition known as ""esophageal varices with a blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome"" or possibly ""gastric varices"" if they are in the cardia region. 

However, given the specific description and the context of the findings, the most likely diagnosis is a ""gastric submucosal lesion"" such as a ""lipoma"" or a ""gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)"" due to the hypoechogenic nature and well-defined characteristics on ultrasound.

Final Diagnosis: Gastric submucosal lesions, likely gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs).",INCORRECT,UNCOMMON,201

This condition can lead to symptoms such as urinary urgency, fever, and the presence of air in the bladder, as seen in the imaging results. The history of multiple ileal ulcers and the subsequent development of an enterovesical fistula suggest a possible link between the ulcers and the fistula formation. The elevated white blood cell count in both blood and urine indicates an infection, which is common in cases of enterovesical fistula due to the passage of intestinal contents into the bladder. The surgical repair of the fistula with ileocecal resection confirms the diagnosis.

physical_exam: Examination was remarkable only for a fever of 39.1¬∞C.
initial_laboratory_results: Infectious workup was unrevealing....CA 19-9 was normal
imaging_test_with_photo: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a large (11 x 8.9 cm), ill-defined, hypodense lesion within the right liver lobe (Figure A).
next_imaging: One cycle of palliative chemotherapy including fluorouracil and oxaliplatin was given. A repeat contrast-enhanced compute tomography performed 7 days after showed rapid expansion of the tumor, now measuring 15 x 9 cm (Figure C).
third_imaging: Autopsy showed extensive tumor involvement of the hepatic parenchyma (Figure D), and numerous peritoneal metastases were also found. ",SiCC is a rare histological variant of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.,"Based on the information provided, the patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent an autologous stem cell transplant. He presents with cyclical fevers and weight loss. The physical examination is notable for a fever, and the infectious workup was negative. Imaging revealed a large, ill-defined, hypodense lesion in the right liver lobe, which rapidly expanded after one cycle of palliative chemotherapy. Autopsy showed extensive tumor involvement of the liver and numerous peritoneal metastases.

Given the rapid growth of the liver lesion and the presence of peritoneal metastases, along with the patient's history of multiple myeloma, the findings are suggestive of a secondary malignancy rather than a recurrence of multiple myeloma. The rapid expansion of the liver mass and the pattern of metastasis are characteristic of a high-grade, aggressive tumor.

The normal CA 19-9 level makes a primary pancreatic or biliary tract malignancy less likely, and the presentation does not fit typical hepatocellular carcinoma. The clinical picture, including the rapid tumor growth and widespread metastasis, suggests a diagnosis of an aggressive secondary malignancy such as a high-grade sarcoma or possibly a poorly differentiated carcinoma.

Considering the patient's history and the aggressive nature of the disease, the most likely diagnosis is a secondary malignancy, potentially a high-grade sarcoma or carcinoma, that developed post-transplant, possibly related to the immunocompromised state following the autologous stem cell transplant.

The rectal examination suggested a rectal mass, but tumor markers were all within normal limits, which reduces the likelihood of certain types of cancer. Imaging studies, including colonoscopy and ultrasound colonoscopy, indicated external compression on the anorectum. MRI findings revealed a pelvic cystic and solid mass in the anterior aspect of the sacrum, suspected to be an abscess or tumor.

Given the presence of a cystic and solid mass in the pelvic region anterior to the sacrum, and considering the normal tumor markers, a possible diagnosis could be a sacrococcygeal teratoma or a presacral tumor such as a chordoma or a schwannoma. However, the suspicion of an abscess based on MRI findings also suggests the possibility of an infected cystic lesion, such as a tailgut cyst or a developmental cyst.

Considering the age of the patient, the location of the mass, and the normal tumor markers, a chordoma, which is a rare type of cancer that occurs in the bones of the skull base and spine, could be a likely diagnosis. However, the presence of cystic components and the suspicion of an abscess also point towards a developmental cyst or a less aggressive neoplasm.

additional_history: A gastroduodenoscopy performed elsewhere for chronic dyspepsia showed a foreign body in the duodenum that was considered to be an endoprothesis in either the pancreas or biliary tract. His medical history showed previous hospital admissions as a result of dyspepsia in 2012 and 2015, and the patient had been homeless for several months in 2012. Laboratory tests in 2012 showed an increased amylase level of 575 U/L (normal range, 0-100 U/L), but at these previous admissions the patient repeatedly had left the hospital before further imaging had taken place.

The gastroduodenoscopy revealed a large plastic fork or spoon in the second part of the duodenum. The patient's medical history includes chronic dyspepsia and elevated amylase levels, which could suggest pancreatitis, but the elevated amylase could also be due to the foreign body causing irritation or blockage.

The abdominal radiograph did not show any endoprothesis in the pancreas or biliary tract, and the CT scan ruled out perforation of the duodenal wall. The presence of a large plastic foreign body in the duodenum explains the patient's symptoms and the elevated amylase levels.

She has undergone palliative radiation therapy and presents with progressive dysphagia, initially to solids and then to both solids and liquids. 

The barium esophagram and esophagogastroduodenoscopy findings indicate a mid-esophageal stricture that was initially responsive to dilation. However, further imaging with PET-CT and esophageal endoscopic ultrasound revealed extensive para-aortic lymphadenopathy with mediastinal hypermetabolic enhancement, suggesting malignant metastasis. This is causing extrinsic compression of the esophagus, as evidenced by the hypoechoic area seen on endoscopic ultrasound.

Given the patient's history of metastatic cervical cancer, the presence of para-aortic and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and the extrinsic compression of the esophagus, the most likely cause of the esophageal stricture and the patient's dysphagia is compression by metastatic lymphadenopathy.

Given these findings, he was diagnosed with segmental ileal xanthomatosis.","Based on the information provided, the key findings are:

1. **Vague Abdominal Symptoms**: The patient presents with non-specific abdominal symptoms, which are common in many gastrointestinal conditions.

2. **Unremarkable Past History and Laboratory Examinations**: This suggests that there are no significant underlying conditions or abnormalities in basic lab tests that could explain the symptoms.

3. **Normal Lipid Profile**: The normal levels of triglycerides, LDL, and HDL suggest that hyperlipidemia-related conditions are unlikely.

4. **Imaging Findings**:
   - **CT Scan**: Shows segmental wall thickening of the ileum.
   - **Double Balloon Enteroscopy**: Reveals a mildly narrowed segment of the ileum with whitish yellow villi.

The combination of segmental wall thickening and the appearance of whitish yellow villi in the ileum is suggestive of a condition affecting the small intestine. The whitish yellow villi could indicate lipid deposition or lymphatic obstruction.

Considering these findings, one possible diagnosis is **intestinal lymphangiectasia**, which is characterized by dilated lymphatic vessels in the intestinal wall leading to lipid deposition and the appearance of whitish villi.

These findings are suggestive of a condition affecting the small intestine, particularly the ileum. The presence of a large diverticulum with ulceration and the associated lymphadenopathy could indicate an inflammatory or infectious process. One possibility is Meckel's diverticulum, which can present with complications such as inflammation (diverticulitis) or ulceration, sometimes leading to bleeding or obstruction. The nodular wall thickening and mucosal hyperenhancement could be due to inflammation or other pathological changes.

Double balloon enteroscopy revealed a small bleeding ileum ulcer with surrounding erythema.

The findings suggest a bleeding source in the small intestine, specifically the ileum. The presence of a small ulcer with surrounding erythema in the ileum is consistent with a condition known as a Dieulafoy's lesion, which is a rare but significant cause of gastrointestinal bleeding. However, the location in the ileum also suggests the possibility of a small bowel tumor or a vascular lesion such as an arteriovenous malformation (AVM).

Considering the chronicity of the bleeding, the localization to the jejunum/ileum, and the findings on double balloon enteroscopy, a small bowel tumor, such as a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) or an AVM, are more likely.
