additional_history: On initial presentation he was found to have diabetic ketoacidosis. Three days later, the patient was re-admitted with smiliar symptoms. He repoted a 28-pound unintentional weight loss.
imaging_test_with_photo: Computed tomography scan on admission showed diffuse small-bowel dilation and wall thickening suggestive of small-bowel obstruction (Figure A).
next_imaging: A nasogastric tube was placed, resulting in 3 L of semisolid output per day. The patient denied prior abdominal surgeries of opioid use, and a colonoscopy 7 years ago was normal. Given diffuse small-bowel diluation, esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed showing marked erythema and edema in the second portion of the duodenum (Figure B).",Strongyloides sterocralis,"Based on the provided patient information, the 57-year-old man presents with symptoms and findings suggestive of a gastrointestinal motility disorder. The key elements to consider are:

1. **Constipation, abdominal distention, nausea, and vomiting**: These symptoms are indicative of gastrointestinal obstruction or motility issues.

2. **Diabetic ketoacidosis**: This condition can be associated with gastroparesis or other motility disorders due to autonomic neuropathy, which is common in long-standing diabetes.

3. **CT scan findings**: The diffuse small-bowel dilation and wall thickening are suggestive of a small-bowel obstruction, but the absence of prior abdominal surgeries and opioid use, along with the normal colonoscopy 7 years ago, make mechanical obstruction less likely.

4. **Nasogastric tube output**: The large volume of semisolid output suggests significant stasis in the upper gastrointestinal tract.

5. **Esophagogastroduodenoscopy findings**: The marked erythema and edema in the second portion of the duodenum could indicate inflammation or ischemia, but also fits with a motility disorder.

Considering these points, the most likely diagnosis is diabetic autonomic neuropathy leading to a form of intestinal pseudo-obstruction, often referred to as diabetic gastroparesis or diabetic enteropathy. This condition is characterized by impaired motility of the gastrointestinal tract due to damage to the nerves that control peristalsis, commonly seen in patients with long-standing diabetes.

10.1053%j.gastro.2013.05.009,"patient_presentation: A 65-year-old man with history of colorectal cancer treated with left hemicolectomy and transverse colon colostomy 6 years ago was admitted to the hospital with bloody colostomy output.
additional_history: His other medical history was notable for type 2 diabetes, obesity, and heavy alcohol use. He has had intermittent bloody colostomy output for the past 3 years. It was bright red blood that would fill his ostomy bag. This has been treated at other hospitals with periodic admission for blood transfusion and as well as with local cautery. A stomal revision was planned but was not performed because of unknown reasons. On admission he was hemodynamically stable, and his blood pressure was 190/100 mmHg.
physical_exam: Physical examination was unremarkable except for pallor, mild splenomegaly, and colostomy. There was no stigmata of chronic liver disease.
initial_laboratory_results: His laboratory values included white blood cell count of 2.7/mm^3, hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL, platelets of 56,000/mm^3, normal electrolytes, urea nitrogen of 12 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase of 30 IU/mL, alanine aminotransferase of 18 IU/mL, alkaline phosphatase of 55 IU/mL, total bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL, and International Normalized Ratio of prothrombin time 1.2.
imaging_test_with_photo: Computed tomography angiography was performed (Figure A) and the patient was referred to interventional radiology for further management.",Peristomal varices secondary to portal hypertension,"Based on the provided information, the patient's clinical presentation and history suggest a condition related to gastrointestinal bleeding. The key points to consider are:

1. **History of Colorectal Cancer**: The patient had a left hemicolectomy and transverse colon colostomy 6 years ago.
2. **Intermittent Bloody Colostomy Output**: Bright red blood in the colostomy bag for the past 3 years, treated with blood transfusions and local cautery.
3. **Physical Exam Findings**: Pallor and mild splenomegaly, with no signs of chronic liver disease.
4. **Laboratory Findings**: Pancytopenia with low white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and low platelet count.
5. **Imaging**: Computed tomography angiography was performed, indicating a vascular assessment.

The combination of intermittent bright red bleeding, splenomegaly, and pancytopenia raises the suspicion of a vascular abnormality, such as a portal hypertensive colopathy or an arteriovenous malformation (AVM). The history of heavy alcohol use could suggest portal hypertension, which might explain the splenomegaly and pancytopenia due to hypersplenism. However, the absence of liver disease stigmata and normal liver function tests make significant liver cirrhosis less likely.

Given the recurrent nature of the bleeding and the previous interventions (cautery and planned stomal revision), a vascular lesion such as an arteriovenous malformation or angiodysplasia is a strong possibility. These lesions can cause recurrent bleeding and are often managed with interventional radiology techniques, as indicated by the referral.

additional_history: She had been on continuous successful PPI treatment of GERD for years....Empiric treatment with oral budesonide failed to improve both the symptoms and endoscopic findings. Our patient denied taking any medication other than pantoprazole and atorvastatin. However, upon extensive interrogation she mentioned that for several months she had accustomed herself to drinking extremely hot coffee.
imaging_without_photo: An esophageal pH metry/impedance-study on PPI showed neither abnormal acidic nor non-acidic reflux. 
imaging_test_with_photo: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy confirmed the absence of any erosions at the gastroesophageal junction. However, shredded whitish membranes covered almost the full length of the tubular esophagus, even forming a 4-5 cm long tubes, which were easily detached from the underlying intact mucosa and pulled out perorally (Video, a). 
next_imaging: Twelve weeks after consequently abstaining from hot beverages esophageal mucosal exfoliation completely disappeared (Video, c).","Thus, we made the diagnosis of exfoliative esophagitis caused by thermal injury.","Based on the information provided, the patient presented with retrosternal pain upon swallowing and had a history of drinking extremely hot coffee. The esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed shredded whitish membranes covering the esophagus, which were easily detached, indicating mucosal damage. Importantly, the symptoms and mucosal exfoliation resolved after the patient abstained from hot beverages.

This presentation is consistent with a condition known as ""thermal injury to the esophagus"" or ""hot beverage-induced esophageal injury."" The consumption of extremely hot liquids can cause thermal damage to the esophageal mucosa, leading to the formation of exfoliative membranes.

During the procedure, white worms approximately 4 to 5 mm in length were observed in the ascending colon. The patient is asymptomatic, and routine laboratory tests were normal.

The description of white worms in the colon is consistent with an infection by Enterobius vermicularis, commonly known as pinworm. Although pinworm infections are more common in children, they can occur in adults as well. The worms are typically small, white, and thread-like, which matches the description given.

10.1053%j.gastro.2012.09.047,"patient_presentation: A 24-year-old woman presented to our department with a complaint of dysphagia since childhood. 
additional_history: She also had history of regurgitation and inadequate weight gain. Her mother revealed history of delayed milestones and absence of tears even as a child. Her past history revealed multiple hospital visits and consultations. Her paternal aunt had undergone surgery for dysphagia. 
physical_exam: Her abdominal examination was normal. On ophthalmologic examination, she was found to have dry eyes with refractory error. Her thyroid hormone levels, blood cortisol and adrenocorticotrophic hormone levels were normal. An adrenocorticotrophic hormone stimulation test was normal. 
imaging_without_photo: Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed hugely dilated esophagus with aperistaltic body and a tight lower esophageal sphincter.
imaging_test_with_photo: On examination, she was poorly built, pale, and had mild to moderate mental retardation with a distinct facies (Figure A).
next_imaging: Periodical barium esophagograms had been performed elsewhere for the patient: Normal at 3 years of age, dilated esophagus at 14 years, bird‚Äôs beak appearance at 19 years (Figure B) and sigmoid esophagus at 24 years (Figure C).",Allgrove syndrome (AAA syndrome),"Based on the provided information, the 24-year-old woman presents with a history of dysphagia since childhood, regurgitation, inadequate weight gain, delayed milestones, and absence of tears. The physical examination reveals dry eyes and mild to moderate mental retardation with distinct facies. The imaging studies show a hugely dilated esophagus with a tight lower esophageal sphincter and a bird's beak appearance on barium esophagogram, which is indicative of achalasia. The presence of a dilated esophagus and a sigmoid esophagus in the imaging studies further supports this.

The combination of these symptoms and findings, particularly the absence of tears (alacrima), dysphagia, and the esophageal motility disorder, suggests a rare genetic disorder known as Allgrove syndrome, also known as Triple A syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by achalasia, alacrima, and adrenal insufficiency, although adrenal insufficiency is not present in this case, it can sometimes manifest later in life. The family history of a paternal aunt with dysphagia and surgery may also suggest a genetic component.

additional_history: There were no significant findings during the procedure. Subsequently, she was transferred to the recovery room and was discharged 40 minutes later. Four hours later, the patient returned to the hospital with severe abdominal pain.
physical_exam: On patient examination she was afebrile, wtih a blood pressure of 110/70 mm Hg, heart rate of 90/min, and a respiratory rate of 16/min. Her abdomen was diffusely tender and tympanitic, especially in the epigastric area, but there were no peritoneal signs.
imaging_test_with_photo: Because a computed tomography scan was not available at that moment, an upright plain abdominal radiograph was obtained (Figure A). The image showed interposition of large bowel loops between the liver and the diaphragm (arrows)...",...a condition known as Chilaiditi syndrome.,"Based on the provided information, the patient is a 50-year-old woman who underwent a routine screening colonoscopy. She was asymptomatic prior to the procedure, which was performed without difficulties. However, four hours after discharge, she returned with severe abdominal pain. The physical examination revealed a diffusely tender and tympanitic abdomen, particularly in the epigastric area, but no peritoneal signs were present. An upright abdominal radiograph showed interposition of large bowel loops between the liver and the diaphragm.

The key findings here are the severe abdominal pain following a colonoscopy and the radiographic finding of large bowel loops between the liver and diaphragm. This description is classic for a condition known as ""Chilaiditi syndrome."" Chilaiditi syndrome occurs when a segment of the colon is interposed between the liver and the diaphragm, which can lead to abdominal pain and other symptoms. It is often an incidental finding but can become symptomatic, especially after procedures like colonoscopy due to increased gas or manipulation.

10.1053%j.gastro.2008.10.069,"patient_presentation: A 42-year-old woman with a past medical history of multiple myeloma, treated with autologous bone marrow transplantation 8 years ago, and deep venous thrombosis, related to antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, presented with hematemesis. 
additional_history: The patient had been on chronic warfarin anticoagulation therapy for the last 2 years. There was no known history of liver disease, excessive alcohol intake, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use.
physical_exam: Upon arrival in the emergency department, the patient‚Äôs blood pressure was 97/57 mmHg and heart rate 86 bpm. Her conjunctivae were pale. She had some facial swelling and prominent chest wall veins without caput medusa. The abdominal examination was normal, without evidence of chronic liver disease.
initial_laboratory_results: The only abnormal initial laboratory values were: hemoglobin 7.5 g/dL and International Normalized Ratio 3.9. Liver function tests were normal. After resuscitation with intravenous fluids and correction of the patient‚Äôs coagulopathy with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K, an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed.
imaging_test_with_photo: Figure A reveals the findings in the esophagus. The stomach and proximal duodenum were normal. ",Downhill esophageal varices secondary to superior vena cava occlusion,"Based on the provided information, the patient is a 42-year-old woman with a history of multiple myeloma and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, currently on warfarin therapy, presenting with hematemesis. The key findings include:

- Pale conjunctivae indicating anemia.
- Facial swelling and prominent chest wall veins suggestive of increased venous pressure.
- An elevated INR of 3.9 due to warfarin therapy, indicating a bleeding tendency.
- Hemoglobin level is low at 7.5 g/dL, consistent with blood loss.
- Normal liver function tests and no evidence of chronic liver disease on examination.

The upper gastrointestinal endoscopy findings in the esophagus are crucial. Although the image is not available here, given the context and the symptoms, the most likely cause of hematemesis in this patient, considering her history of increased venous pressure and anticoagulation therapy, is esophageal varices.

Esophageal varices are dilated veins in the esophagus that can rupture and bleed, often associated with portal hypertension. The facial swelling and prominent chest wall veins could indicate superior vena cava syndrome or another cause of increased venous pressure, potentially related to her history of multiple myeloma or complications thereof.

10.1016%j.cgh.2018.05.012,"patient_presentation: An 80-year-old man presented to our hospital with 2 weeks of worsening vomiting and anorexia. 
additional_history: He had no abdominal pain and only had slight abdominal distention on physical examination.
imaging_test_with_photo: Abdominal radiography demostrated dilatation of the small intestine and retention of gas in the one long segment of the small intestinal wall (Figure A).
next_imaging: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed massive gas-filled cysts within the wall and mesentery of the small intestine (Figure B).
third_imaging: Intraperitoneal free air and moderate ascites (Figure C), and retroperitoneal emphysema were also present. No features suggested portal venous gas or intestinal ischemia. Colon wall thickening, seen as a homogeneous enhancement extending from the ascending to the descending colon, was also identified. ",We diagnosed pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis (PCI) and instituted conservative management such as fasting treatment and antibiotic therapy.,"Based on the provided information, the patient is an 80-year-old man with worsening vomiting and anorexia, slight abdominal distention, and imaging findings that include dilatation of the small intestine, gas-filled cysts within the wall and mesentery of the small intestine, intraperitoneal free air, moderate ascites, retroperitoneal emphysema, and colon wall thickening extending from the ascending to the descending colon.

The key findings here are the presence of massive gas-filled cysts within the wall of the small intestine, which is characteristic of pneumatosis intestinalis. The presence of intraperitoneal free air and retroperitoneal emphysema suggests a perforation or a significant breach in the intestinal wall. However, the absence of features suggesting portal venous gas or intestinal ischemia is notable. The colon wall thickening could suggest a secondary process or inflammation.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis, which is a condition characterized by the presence of gas cysts within the wall of the intestine. This condition can be associated with various underlying causes, including mechanical, bacterial, or biochemical factors, and is sometimes seen in conjunction with other gastrointestinal or systemic conditions.

initial_laboratory_results: Abnormal protein in the serum and urine were not observed, and cardiac function was normal. 
imaging_test_with_photo: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed large blood clots and active bleeding from the mucosa in the fundus and the cardia of the stomach (Figure A). The mucosa was so fragile that contact with the scope caused new bleeding....
next_imaging: EGD showed a submucosal hematoma in the esophagus (Figure B), which was not observed when the examination started.
third_imaging: Repeat EGD the following day showed hemostasis and multiple yellow deposits in the mucosa of the stomach and duodenum (Figure C).","From these findings, the final diagnosis was localized amyloid light-chain amyoloidosis of the upper gastrointestinal tract.","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 65-year-old man who presented with hematemesis. The initial esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed large blood clots and active bleeding from the mucosa in the stomach, with fragile mucosa that bled upon contact. A subsequent EGD showed a submucosal hematoma in the esophagus, and a repeat EGD the next day revealed hemostasis and multiple yellow deposits in the mucosa of the stomach and duodenum.

The combination of hematemesis, fragile gastric mucosa, submucosal hematoma, and yellow deposits suggests a condition that affects the integrity of the gastrointestinal mucosa and leads to bleeding and hematoma formation. One condition that can present with these findings is gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE), also known as ""watermelon stomach,"" which can cause bleeding and is characterized by friable mucosa. However, the presence of submucosal hematoma and yellow deposits suggests a different etiology.

Given the presentation of hematemesis, fragile mucosa, submucosal hematoma, and yellow deposits, a more likely diagnosis is a bleeding disorder such as acquired or hereditary coagulopathy, which can lead to spontaneous bleeding and hematoma formation. The yellow deposits could be related to hemosiderin or bile staining secondary to previous bleeding.

10.1053%j.gastro.2015.06.054,"patient_presentation: A 20-year-old man was referred for increasing abdominal girth. 
additional_history: Three years previously, he developed voluminous milky diarrhea and was diagnosed with protein-losing enteropathy. His diarrhea subsequently resolved, but he then developed abdominal distention. An upper endoscopy and colonoscopy performed at another facility were reported to be normal. He had no other significant medical, surgical, or family history.
physical_exam: On physical examination, the abdomen was distended with striae and shifting dullness. Nine liters of milky white fluid was removed by paracentesis.
initial_laboratory_results: Ascitic fluid analysis showed a high nucleated cell count of 611/ŒºL with a predominance of monocytes (58%) and lymphocytes (42%). Total ascitic fluid protein was 3 g/dL with an albumin of 1.8 g/dL and the serum albumin was 2.8 g/dL. Lipid analysis of the peritoneal fluid revealed a triglyceride level of 1692 mg/dL and visible chylomicrons on microscopy.
imaging_test_with_photo: To further evaluate these findings, a computed tomographic (CT) enterography with lymphangiographic contrast was obtained (Figure A).",Segmental colonic lymphangiectasia,"Based on the information provided, the patient has a history of protein-losing enteropathy and now presents with abdominal distention and milky ascites. The ascitic fluid analysis shows a high triglyceride level and the presence of chylomicrons, indicating that the fluid is chylous in nature. The presence of chylous ascites suggests a disruption or obstruction in the lymphatic system, which could be due to a variety of causes such as lymphatic malformations, trauma, infections, or malignancies.

Given the patient's young age and the chronic nature of his symptoms, a congenital or developmental lymphatic disorder is a likely consideration. One such condition is intestinal lymphangiectasia, which can lead to protein-losing enteropathy and chylous ascites due to dilated lymphatic vessels leaking lymph into the intestinal lumen and peritoneal cavity.

The CT enterography with lymphangiographic contrast would likely show dilated lymphatic channels or other abnormalities in the lymphatic system, supporting a diagnosis related to lymphatic dysfunction.

imaging_test_with_photo: Figures A‚ÄìC are endoscopic images from the posterior wall of the mid-ascending colon.",Tension-free vaginal tape eroding into the ascending colon,"To provide an accurate diagnosis, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Patient Background**: The patient is a 46-year-old woman with primary hyperparathyroidism. This condition can sometimes be associated with gastrointestinal symptoms, but the primary concern here is the recent onset of diarrhea and abdominal pain.

2. **Symptom Onset**: The symptoms began suddenly after a holiday in Lanzarote, Spain, which could suggest an infectious etiology, possibly a travel-related infection.

3. **Symptoms**: The patient has been experiencing diarrhea and right-sided abdominal pain for 5 months. The diarrhea is described as watery, which could indicate an infectious or inflammatory process.

4. **Past Medical History**: She underwent a vaginal hysterectomy and a procedure for stress incontinence, which are likely unrelated to the current gastrointestinal symptoms.

5. **Laboratory Results**:
   - Hemoglobin: 126 g/L (normal range for women is approximately 120-160 g/L), indicating no significant anemia.
   - C-reactive protein (CRP): 1 (normal range is typically <10 mg/L), suggesting no active inflammation or infection.
   - Albumin: 37 g/L (normal range is approximately 35-50 g/L), indicating normal protein levels and no significant malnutrition or protein loss.

6. **Endoscopic Images**: While the images are not visible in this context, the mention of endoscopic images from the mid-ascending colon suggests that the colonoscopy was performed to investigate the cause of diarrhea and abdominal pain.

Given the sudden onset of symptoms following travel, the chronicity of symptoms (5 months), and the normal laboratory findings (no signs of inflammation or infection), the differential diagnosis could include:

- **Infectious Colitis**: However, the normal CRP and the chronicity make this less likely unless it was an initial infection with residual effects.
- **Inflammatory Bowel Disease**: Typically would show elevated CRP and possibly anemia.
- **Microscopic Colitis**: Often presents with chronic watery diarrhea, normal CRP, and normal colonoscopy findings unless biopsies are taken.
- **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)**: Could present with diarrhea and abdominal pain, especially post-infectious IBS after a travel-related infection.

Considering the information available and the normal laboratory findings, a likely diagnosis is **Microscopic Colitis**, which is characterized by chronic watery diarrhea and normal endoscopic findings, often requiring biopsy for diagnosis.

Her medical history includes hypertension, and she is taking enteric-coated aspirin, which could contribute to bleeding. However, the key findings are from the video capsule endoscopy and enteroscopy, which revealed fresh blood and a 3-cm lobular circumferential mass with a lymphangiectatic appearance in the proximal jejunum, along with several submucosal lesions in the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum.

The presence of a lobular mass with a lymphangiectatic appearance and multiple submucosal lesions is suggestive of a vascular lesion. The most likely diagnosis, considering the age of the patient and the characteristics of the lesions, is a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) or possibly a vascular lesion such as an angiodysplasia or a hemangioma. However, the lymphangiectatic appearance and the presence of multiple submucosal lesions lean more towards a vascular pathology.

The high ferritin level in the context of low iron saturation and microcytic anemia suggests anemia of chronic disease or iron sequestration rather than iron deficiency anemia. The patient also has hypoalbuminemia, elevated total protein, and splenomegaly.

The PET scan showing uptake in axillary lymph nodes and bone marrow, along with the presence of multiple non-enlarged lymph nodes, suggests a possible hematological malignancy or lymphoproliferative disorder.

The upper endoscopy findings of nodular whitish duodenal mucosa with scalloping and erosions are highly suggestive of intestinal involvement by a lymphoproliferative disorder. In the context of the patient's age, the presence of lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and these endoscopic findings, one possible diagnosis is Waldenstr√∂m macroglobulinemia (WM) or another type of low-grade B-cell lymphoma with gastrointestinal involvement.

Waldenstr√∂m macroglobulinemia is characterized by lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma with bone marrow involvement and IgM monoclonal gammopathy, which could explain the elevated total protein. The anemia could be due to bone marrow infiltration and the chronic disease process.

next_imaging: However, when performing image-enhanced endoscopy with LCI, a shallow depressed lesion was identified in the prepyloric area and this modality made it easier to detect the lesion, but the visibility was insufficient to distinguish between the lesion and the surrounding area (Figure B).
third_imaging: CE using an AIM with LCI enhanced not only the surface color, but also the demarcation line of the lesion (Figure C).",The pathologic diagnosis of the resected specimen showed well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the stomach.,"Based on the information provided, the patient underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy for screening, and a shallow depressed lesion was identified in the prepyloric area using image-enhanced endoscopy with LCI (Linked Color Imaging). The visibility of the lesion was further enhanced using CE (Chromatic Enhancement) with AIM (Advanced Imaging Modality) and LCI, which improved the surface color and demarcation line of the lesion.

In this context, the identification of a shallow depressed lesion in the prepyloric area, particularly in an elderly patient, raises the suspicion of an early gastric cancer, such as an early gastric adenocarcinoma. The use of advanced imaging techniques to enhance the visibility and demarcation of the lesion is consistent with the diagnostic workup for detecting early-stage gastric cancers, which can be subtle and difficult to identify with standard white-light endoscopy.

additional_history: He denied diarrhea, fever, or weight loss.
physical_exam: Physical examination was unremarkable.
initial_laboratory_results: Blood test revealed normal hemoglobin level (15.7 g/dL).
imaging_without_photo: In addition to internal hemorrhoids, a small whitish worm was found attached to the cecum on colonoscopy.
imaging_test_with_photo: Its straight, thick end was movable and the other thread-like end was embedded in the mucosa (Figure A, arrow), which could be clearly seen while extracting the worm with biopsy forceps (Figure B).",Trichuris trichiura infection,"Based on the information provided, the key findings from the colonoscopy include the presence of a small whitish worm attached to the cecum. The description of the worm, with one end being straight and thick and the other end thread-like and embedded in the mucosa, is characteristic of a whipworm infection. 

Whipworms, or Trichuris trichiura, are a type of parasitic worm that can infect the large intestine. The description matches the appearance of the adult whipworm, with its thick posterior end and thin, thread-like anterior end that embeds into the intestinal mucosa.

Given the patient's occupation as a part-time farmer, it is possible that he has been exposed to environments where whipworm eggs could be present, such as soil contaminated with human feces.

imaging_test_with_photo: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy identified a large, hyperpigmented excavated ulcer with several depressed lesions in the anturm (Figures A and B).
next_imaging: Subsequent oncologic reevaluation with positron emission tomography confirmed a partial remission without hypermetabolic gastroduodenal lesions (Figure D).",...findings consistent with tumoral melanosis.,"Based on the information provided, the patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of BRAF^V600 mutated malignant melanoma that relapsed with metastases to the liver, adrenal glands, and small bowel. He is being treated with dabrafenib and trametinib, which are targeted therapies for BRAF-mutated melanoma. 

The patient presents with fluctuating epigastric pain, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy reveals a large, hyperpigmented excavated ulcer with several depressed lesions in the antrum. However, a subsequent PET scan shows partial remission of the melanoma without hypermetabolic gastroduodenal lesions.

The presence of a large, hyperpigmented ulcer in the gastric antrum in the context of melanoma raises suspicion for gastric metastasis from melanoma. Melanoma is known for its potential to metastasize to the gastrointestinal tract, and the hyperpigmented nature of the ulcer is consistent with melanoma, which can produce melanin.

However, the PET scan did not show hypermetabolic activity in the gastroduodenal region, which might suggest that the lesions are not actively metabolizing, possibly due to the effects of the treatment leading to necrosis or reduced metabolic activity.

Taking into account the patient's history of metastatic melanoma, the hyperpigmented nature of the gastric lesions, and the treatment regimen, the most likely diagnosis for the gastric findings is metastatic melanoma to the stomach.

The esophagogastroduodenoscopy was normal, and the bone marrow examination was normal as well. The physical examination was essentially normal, but laboratory tests revealed mild anemia and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level. Colonoscopy showed multiple nodular lesions in the rectum, sigmoid colon, and cecum, and CT imaging revealed irregular, nonenhancing mucosal thickening in these areas.

The combination of symptoms (hematochezia, weight loss), the presence of multiple nodular lesions in the colon, elevated LDH, and the imaging findings suggest a possible diagnosis of lymphoma involving the gastrointestinal tract. The elevated LDH is often associated with high cell turnover, which is common in lymphoproliferative disorders. Gastrointestinal lymphomas, particularly non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, can present with these findings.

additional_history: Pain initially was severe along with vomiting, over the next few days pain subsided, and she was jaundiced on presentation to the hospital. Her past medical history was unremarkable.
initial_laboratory_results: Pertinent laboratory data showed a normal white cell count, total bilirubin of 11.6 mg/dL (normal, 0.2-1.3), alkaline phosphatase 200 U/L (normal, 38-126), aspartate aminotransferase 157 U/L (normal, 13-40), and serum lipase 28 U/L (normal, 7-59)....Murphy's sign was negative.

imaging_test_with_photo: On Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), the initial cholangiogram showed normal CBD of 3 mm in diameter with complete cutoff at the cystic duct take-off (Figure A).
next_imaging: On forced contrast injection the upstream cystic duct and common hepatic duct were opacified (Figure B).
third_imaging: After biliary sphincterotomy, a plastic biliary stent was placed with good drainage (Figure C).",Mirizzi syndrome with white bile syndrome,"Based on the provided information, the patient is a 28-year-old woman with a 1-week history of right upper quadrant pain, vomiting, and subsequent jaundice. The laboratory results show elevated total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and aspartate aminotransferase, indicating cholestasis and hepatocellular injury. The ultrasound findings of a dilated common bile duct and intrahepatic ductal dilation, along with cholelithiasis, suggest a possible obstruction in the biliary system.

The ERCP findings are crucial: the initial cholangiogram showed a normal common bile duct diameter with a complete cutoff at the cystic duct take-off, indicating a blockage at this location. Upon forced contrast injection, the cystic duct and common hepatic duct were opacified, which suggests that the obstruction was relieved or bypassed. The placement of a biliary stent with good drainage further supports the presence of an obstructive process that was alleviated by the intervention.

The clinical picture, along with the imaging and procedural findings, is consistent with Mirizzi syndrome. This condition occurs when a gallstone becomes impacted in the cystic duct or neck of the gallbladder, causing compression of the common hepatic duct, leading to jaundice and cholestasis. The negative Murphy's sign and the imaging findings support this diagnosis.

additional_history: Regular follow-up evaluation suggested no further abnormality. Neither preoperative examination nor follow-up consultations, which included echocardiogram, chest computed tomography (CT), and poistron-emission tomography-CT scans, managed to identify metastatic signs.
imaging_test_with_photo: This prompted further investigation and a subsequent echocardiogram showed a 24 x 20 mm mass in the right ventricle cavity (Figure A). A contrast-enhanced CT confirmed this finding and identified an additional mass in the right ventricular free-wall. 
next_imaging: Both masses appeared well defined and round with uniform density, although with no obvious enhancement (Figure B). The masses were completely resected through ventriculotomy and then characterized as solitary intact nodular gross pathologic types. The smaller mass (10 x 10 x 10 mm) was located in the myocardium near the apex of the right ventricular anterior wall.
third_imaging: The pedicle of the larger mass (30 x 30 x 20 mm) was attached to the posterior wall of the right ventricle (Figure C).",Hepatocellular carcinoma metastatic tumor.,"Based on the information provided, the patient has a history of hepatocellular carcinoma and underwent a right hemihepatectomy 3 years ago. Despite regular follow-ups, no metastatic signs were detected until recently when the patient presented with shortness of breath. Imaging studies revealed masses in the right ventricle, which were surgically resected. The characteristics of these masses, such as being well-defined, round, and with uniform density, along with their location in the heart, suggest a metastatic process from the original hepatocellular carcinoma.

Given the patient's history of hepatocellular carcinoma and the presence of cardiac masses, the most likely diagnosis is cardiac metastasis from the primary liver cancer. Hepatocellular carcinoma is known to metastasize to the heart, although it is relatively rare.

Surgical exploration revealed innumerable liver lesions suspicious for metastatic carcinoid, which were not detected on preoperative CT or MRI scans. The planned pancreaticoduodenectomy and partial gastrectomy suggest a suspicion of a primary tumor in the pancreas or stomach area, possibly a neuroendocrine tumor.

Carcinoid tumors are a type of neuroendocrine tumor that can metastasize to the liver, often presenting with multiple lesions that might not always be visible on imaging studies until they are numerous or large enough. The gastrointestinal bleeding could be related to the primary tumor or metastatic lesions causing ulceration or other complications.

Given the surgical findings and the context of the planned procedures, the most likely diagnosis is metastatic carcinoid tumor (neuroendocrine tumor) with liver metastases.

additional_history: Initial weight loss from 65 to 51 kg stabilized on a self-imposed diet of nutritious soup. The patient was otherwise in good health except for regular episodes of dizziness on standing. She was not taking medications. Medical help had not been sought earlier because the patient was the primary caregiver for a disabled husband in their isolated farmhouse. The patient reported that her symptoms commenced after she had been struck by lightening during a fierce electrical storm. A shining sphere of light floated into the house as she opened the front door, planning to close the farm gates that were rattling in the wind. A moment later, the ball lightening exploded and she was thrown across the room and left temporarily unconscious. From that moment on, she was unable to swallow normally.
initial_laboratory_results: Routine hematology and biochemistry blood tests were normal. During the examination, orthostatic hypotension was documented with a >20 mmHg drop of blood pressure accompanied by near syncope on 2 occasions. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm without reactive tachycardia, suggesting autonomic dysfunction as a cause of her symptoms.
imaging_without_photo: Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed no obstructive lesion and no mucosal disease.
imaging_test_with_photo: Uncoordinated contractions with mild delay of bolus transport were observed on barium esophagram (Figure A).
next_imaging: High-resolution manometry was performed to establish the diagnosis. In a vivid case of nature imitating art, the unusual appearance of the spatiotemporal plot was reminiscent of an electrical storm (Figure B).",Struck dysphagic,"Based on the information provided, the patient is an 85-year-old woman with a 9-month history of cramping chest pain and dysphagia for both liquids and solids following an incident involving a lightning strike. The symptoms began immediately after the event, suggesting a potential link between the lightning strike and the onset of her condition. The patient also experiences orthostatic hypotension and autonomic dysfunction, as indicated by the drop in blood pressure without reactive tachycardia.

The barium esophagram shows uncoordinated contractions with a mild delay in bolus transport, and high-resolution manometry reveals an unusual spatiotemporal plot reminiscent of an electrical storm. These findings are indicative of an esophageal motility disorder.

The combination of cramping chest pain, dysphagia, and the manometry findings suggest a diagnosis of achalasia, a condition characterized by the failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax and the presence of uncoordinated esophageal contractions. The association with the lightning strike could be coincidental, but it is possible that the electrical event affected the autonomic nervous system, leading to the development of this motility disorder.

third_imaging: The consumptive coagulopathy in this patient was reserved with cyroprecipitate; repeat imaging 6 weeks later showed resolution of the colonic wall thickening and edema (Figure D).","Thus, the patient was diagnosed with chronic disseminated intravascular coagulopathy secondary to shearing from the aortic dissection subsequently causing skin and colonic hematomas.","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of chronic aortic dissection who presented with right lower abdominal pain and hematochezia. The laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy with an elevated INR, hypofibrinogenemia, and significantly increased D-dimer levels, all of which are indicative of a consumptive coagulopathy, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The CT angiography findings of marked edema and wall thickening of the ascending colon with hypervascularity, along with the colonoscopy findings of smooth, blue-purple nonobstructing masses, suggest the presence of ischemic colitis, possibly secondary to the coagulopathy.

The resolution of colonic wall thickening and edema after treatment with cryoprecipitate further supports the diagnosis of ischemic colitis secondary to DIC. The presence of skin hematomas and the patient's chronic aortic dissection history may have contributed to the development of DIC, leading to ischemic changes in the colon.

These findings are highly suggestive of peritoneal tuberculosis, particularly given the patient's history of immigration from India, where tuberculosis is more prevalent. The presence of ascites, peritoneal thickening, and nodular lesions in the omentum are classic signs of peritoneal tuberculosis. The pulmonary nodules could represent a form of disseminated tuberculosis, although they are not typical for active pulmonary TB.

The multicystic appearance of the ovaries could be due to an inflammatory process, possibly related to the tuberculosis infection affecting the peritoneum and surrounding structures.
