By standardizing the ramp's height during each trial, Juan and LaKeisha can isolate the effect of the objects' properties on the distance rolled. If they fail to adjust the ramp to a consistent height, external factors like gravity and incline could introduce variability, making it impossible to reliably compare results across trials.

By contrast, meticulously documenting the ramp’s height, objects used, and methodology (D) allows them to replicate every aspect of the setup in future trials.\n\n**Key Takeaway**:  \nControlling variables like ramp height is part of good experimental design, but *recording those details* is what enables true repeatability.\n\nAnswer: D', type='TextMessage'), TextMessage(source='Collaborator_0', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=891, completion_tokens=69), content='After considering the reasoning presented by all collaborators, I maintain that the primary action Juan and LaKeisha should take to ensure they can repeat their investigation is to record the details of their investigation.
